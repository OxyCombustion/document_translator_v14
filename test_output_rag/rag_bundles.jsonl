Heat transfer is important in fossil fuel \ncombustion, chemical reaction processes, electrical \nsystems, nuclear fission and certain fluid systems. It \nalso occurs during everyday activities including cooking, \nheating and refrigeration, as well as being an important \nconsideration in choosing clothing for different climates.\nAlthough the fundamentals of heat transfer are simple, \npractical applications are complex because real systems \ncontain irregular geometries, combined modes of heat \ntransfer and time dependent responses.\nFundamentals\nBasic modes of heat transfer\nThere are three modes of heat transfer: conduction, \nconvection and radiation. One or more of these modes \ncontrols the amount of heat transfer in all applications. \nConduction  Temperature is a property that indicates\nthe kinetic energy possessed by the molecules of a \nsubstance; the higher the temperature the greater the \nkinetic energy or molecular activity of the substance. \nMolecular conduction of heat is simply the transfer of \nenergy due to a temperature difference between adjacent \nmolecules in a solid, liquid or gas.\nConduction heat transfer is evaluated using Fourier’s \nlaw:\n\t\n\t\n(1)\nThe flow of heat, qc, is positive when the temperature \ngradient, dT/dx, is negative. This result, consistent with \nthe second law of thermodynamics, indicates that heat \nflows in the direction of decreasing temperature. The \nheat flow, qc, is in a direction normal (or perpendicular) \nto an area, A, and the gradient, dT/dx, is the rate of \ntemperature change in the direction of heat flow. The \nthermal conductivity, k, a property of the material, \nquantifies its ability to conduct heat. A range of thermal \nconductivities is listed in Table 1. The integrated form \nof the conduction law is written:\n\t\n\t\n(2)\nFig. 1 illustrates positive heat flow described by \nthis equation and shows the effect of variable thermal \nq\nkA dT\ndx\nc = −\nq\nkA\nL\nT\nT\n=\n−\n(\n)\n1\n2\nChapter 4\nHeat Transfer\nconductivity on the temperature distribution. The \ngrouping kA/L is known as the thermal conductance, Kc; \nthe inverse L/kA is known as the thermal resistance, Rc \nand Kc = 1/Rc.\nA special case of conduction is the thermal contact \nresistance across a joint between solid materials. At the \ninterface of two solid materials the surface-to-surface \ncontact is imperfect from the gap that prevails due to \nsurface roughness. In nuclear applications with fuel \npellets and fuel cladding, surface contact resistance can \nhave a major impact on heat transfer. If one dimensional \nsteady heat flow is assumed, the heat transfer across a \ngap is defined by:\n\t\n\t\n(3)\nwhere the quantity Rct is called the thermal contact \nresistance, 1/hctA, and hct is called the contact coefficient. \nT1 and T2 are the average surface temperatures on each \nside of the gap. Tabulated values of the contact coefficient \nare presented in References 1 and 2. Examples include \n300 Btu/h ft2 F (1.7 kW/m2 K) between two sections of \nground 304 stainless steel in air and 25,000 Btu/h ft2 \nF (142 kW/m2 K) between two sections of ground copper \nin air. The factors are usually unknown for specific \napplications and estimates need to be made.

{"chunk_id": "unit_001_page_004", "page_number": 4, "text": "4-4\nSteam 42 / Heat Transfer\nThe Babcock & Wilcox Company\nThermal radiation generally passes through gases \nsuch as dry air with no absorption taking place. These \nnonabsorbing, or nonparticipating, gases do not affect \nthe radiative transfer. Other gases, like carbon dioxide, \nwater vapor and carbon monoxide, to a lesser degree, \naffect radiative transfer and are known as participating \ngases. These gases, prevalent in the flue gases of a boiler, \naffect the heat transfer to surfaces and the distribution \nof energy absorbed in the boiler.\nAll bodies continuously emit radiant energy in \namounts which are determined by the temperature and \nthe nature of the surface. A perfect radiator, or blackbody, \nabsorbs all of the incident thermal radiation, G, reaching \nits surface:\n\t\n\t\n(6)\nand emits radiant energy at the maximum theoretical \nlimit according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n\t\n\t\n(7)\nwhere s is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant 0.1713 × 10−8 \nBtu/h ft2 R4 (5.669 × 10−8 W/m2 K4), and Ts is the absolute \ntemperature of the surface, R (K). The product s Ts4 is \nalso known as the blackbody emissive power, Eb. The net \nradiative heat transfer of a blackbody is the difference \nbetween absorbed and emitted radiant energy:\n\t\n\t\n(8)\nThe radiation from a blackbody extends over the \nwhole range of wavelengths, although the bulk of it in \nboiler applications is concentrated in a band from 0.1 to \n20 micrometers. The wavelength at which the maximum \nradiation intensity occurs is inversely proportional to \nthe absolute temperature of the body; this is known as \nWien’s law.\nA real radiator absorbs less than 100% of the energy \nincident on it and emits less than the maximum theoreti­\ncal limit. The net heat transfer by radiation from a real \nsurface can be expressed by:\n\t\n\t\n(9)\nwhere e is the total emissivity and a is the total absorptiv­\nity. If the emissivity and absorptivity are independent of \nwavelength, the surface is termed a nonselective radiator, \nor gray surface. According to Kirchhoff’s law, emissivity \nand absorptivity are always equal for a gray surface:\n\t\n\t\n(10)\nTherefore, a can be eliminated from Equation 9, \nand emissivity is all that is needed to describe the \nradiation properties of the surface. Table 3 shows some \nrepresentative values of emissivity. If all surfaces are \nassumed to be gray, a simpler treatment of radiation \nis possible. For two surface enclosures, this treatment \ninvolves introducing a total exchange factor, F12, which \ndepends on the configuration (geometry), the emissivities \nand the surface areas.3 \nIf the emissivity depends on wavelength, the surface \nis termed a selective or nongray radiator.

Total emissivity is the integrated average of \ne l over the spectrum of emitted radiation, and total \nabsorptivity is the integrated average of a l over the \nspectrum of incident radiation. The terms emissivity \nand emittance (and corresponding terms absorptivity \nand absorptance) are commonly interchanged in the \nliterature. For convenience, the term emittance is used \nhere for total emissivity and absorptance is used for total \nabsorptivity, of nongray surfaces.\nFor nongray surfaces, the emittance can be expressed \nas a function of the surface temperature e (Ts), and \nabsorptance as a function of the incident radiation or \nflame temperature, a(Tf). Based on Kirchhoff’s law, plots \nof e versus Ts may be interpreted as plots of a versus \nTf if the physical state of the surface is unchanged. An \nanalysis of nongray conditions requires temperature \ndependent emittance and absorptance, or spectral \nproperty calculations which are more complicated. An \nexample of nongray radiators in a boiler is the ash deposits \non waterwall heating surfaces.\nThe net radiation heat transfer between two blackbody \nsurfaces which are separated by a vacuum or nonpartici­\npating gas is written:\n\t\n\t\n(11)\nA1 is the surface area; F12 is the geometric shape factor and \nrepresents the fraction of radiant energy leaving surface \n1 that directly strikes surface 2. As will be discussed \nlater for radiation between two surfaces, F12 is the \nexchange factor for two surfaces based on the geometric \narrangement only, and F12 is the exchange factor that \nincludes the effects of emissivity for gray surfaces, and \nparticipating media between the surfaces. For blackbody \nsurfaces (e1 = e2 = 1) and nonparticipating media, F12 = \nF12. T1 and T2 are the surface temperatures. Since the \nnet energy at surface 1 must balance the net energy at \nsurface 2, we can write:\n\t\n\t\n(12)\nUsing Equations 11 and 12, the following results:\n\t\n\t\n(13)\nThis equation, known as the principle of reciprocity, \nguarantees conservation of the radiant heat transfer \nbetween two surfaces.

This usually involves idealizing the actual \nsystem by defining a schematic control volume of the \nmodeled system.

For \nexample, for the plane wall shown in Fig. 1, the steady \nflow energy balance for a slice of thickness, dx, is:\n\t\n\t\n(17)\nAfter substituting Equation 1, this is rewritten as:\n\t\n\t\n(18)\nThe conditions at the boundaries, T = T1 at x = 0 and T = \nT2 at x = L, provide closure.

All \nunsteady-state conduction involves heat storage. For \ninstance, in heating a furnace, enough heat must be \nsupplied to bring the walls to the operating temperature \nand also to make up for the steady-state losses of normal \noperation.

In small \nboilers with refractory that are operated only part time, or \nin furnaces that are frequently heated and cooled in batch \nprocess work, heat stored in the walls during startup may \nbe a considerable portion of the total heat input.\nUnsteady-state conduction is important when equal­\nizing boiler drum temperature during pressure raising \nand reducing periods. When boiler pressure is raised, \nthe water temperature rises. The inner surface of the \nsteam drum is heated by contact with the water below \nthe water line and by the condensation of steam above the \nwater line. The inside and outside drum temperatures \nare increased by unsteady-state conduction. During this \ntransient heatup period, temperature differentials across \nthe drum wall (or thermal gradients) will be larger than \nduring steady-state operation. Larger thermal gradients \nresult in higher thermal stresses as discussed in Chapter \n8. The rate of temperature and pressure increase must \ntherefore be controlled to maintain the thermal stresses \nwithin acceptable levels to protect the drum. During \npressure reducing periods, the inside of the drum below \nthe water line is cooled by boiler water while the top of \nthe drum is cooled by radiation to the water, by the steam \nflow to the outlet connections, and by unsteady-state \nconduction through the drum walls.\nUnsteady-state conduction occurs in heating or \ncooling processes where temperatures change with \ntime. Examples include heating billets, quenching steel, \noperating regenerative heaters, raising boiler pressure, \nand heating and cooling steam turbines. By introducing \ntime as an additional variable, conduction analyses \nbecome more complicated. For unsteady heat flow, the \none-dimensional thermal energy equation becomes:\n\t\n\t\n(21)\nThe left side of the equation represents the rate of energy \nstorage. The two boundary temperatures at x = 0 and \nL, and the initial temperature, T = T o, are sufficient \nto find a solution.

A multi-zone, \nthree-dimensional numerical analysis is then required, \nbecause simple expressions of surface heat transfer and \nparticipating media cannot be solved analytically.\nNumerical analysis of radiation heat transfer in multi-\ndimensional applications with absorption, emission and \nscattering is routinely applied with commercially avail­\nable computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. This \ninvolves the solution of an integral-differential equation \nfor radiation intensity as a function of position, direction \nand wavelength.

The relative order of magnitude of values \nfor various substances is shown in Table 7. Thermal \nconductivities are generally highest for solids, lower for \nliquids and lower yet for gases. Insulating materials have \nthe lowest conductivities of solid materials.\nThermal conductivities of pure metals generally \ndecrease with an increase in temperature, while alloy \nconductivities may either increase or decrease. (See Fig. \n7.) Conductivities of several steels and alloys are shown \nin Table 7. Thermal conductivities of various refractory \nmaterials are shown in Chapter 23, Fig. 11. For many \nheat transfer calculations it is sufficiently accurate to \nassume a constant thermal conductivity that corresponds \nto the average temperature of the material.\nThe effective thermal conductivity of ash deposits on \nwaterwall heating surfaces varies widely depending on \ntemperature, composition, heating cycle and physical \ncharacteristics of the deposits. The lower limit is close to \nthe thermal conductivity of air or lower [0.03 Btu/h ft F \n(0.05 W/m K)], and the upper limit does not exceed values \nq\nJ\nG\nA\nE\nE\nsg\ns\ns\ns\ns\ng\nbg\ng\nbs\ng\ns\n=\n−\n=\n−\n(\n)\n−\n−\n(\n)\n−\n(\n)\nε\nε\nα\nα\nε\n1\n1\n1\nq\nA\nE\nE\nsg\ns\ng\nbg\ng\nbs\n=\n−\n(\n)\nε\nα\nfor refractory materials [1.4 Btu/h ft F (2.4 W/m K)].

Water properties \nare relatively insensitive to pressure, particularly at pres­\nsures far from the critical point. Most other nonmetallic \nliquid thermal conductivities range from 0.05 to 0.15 \nBtu/h ft F (0.09 to 0.26 W/m K). In addition, thermal \nconductivities of most liquids decrease with temperature.\nThe thermal conductivities of gases increase with \ntemperature and are independent of pressure at normal \nboiler conditions. These conductivities generally decrease \nwith increasing molecular weight. The relatively high \nconductivity of helium (a low molecular weight gas) makes \nit a good medium for cryogenic cooling. The relatively low \nconductivity of argon (a high molecular weight gas) makes \nit a good insulating medium for thermal pane windows.\nWhen calculating the conductivity of nonhomogeneous \nmaterials, the designer must use an apparent thermal \nconductivity to account for the porous or layered construc­\ntion materials. In boilers and furnaces with refractory \nwalls, thermal conductivity may vary from site to site \ndue to variations in structure, composition, density or \nporosity when the materials were installed. The thermal \nconductivities of these materials are strongly dependent \non their apparent bulk density (mass per unit volume). \nFor higher temperature insulations, the apparent \nthermal conductivity of fibrous insulations and insulating \nfirebrick decreases as bulk density increases because \nthe denser material attenuates the radiation. However, \nan inflection occurs at some point at which a further \nincrease in density increases the thermal conductivity \ndue to conduction in the solid material.\nTheory shows that specific heats of solids and liquids \nare generally independent of pressure. Table 7 lists spe­\ncific heats of various metals, alloys and nonhomogeneous \nmaterials at 68F (20C). These values may be used at other \ntemperatures without significant error.\nThe temperature dependence of the specific heat for \ngases is more pronounced than for solids and liquids. In \nboiler applications, pressure dependence may generally \nbe neglected. Tables 8a and 8b give specific heat data for \nair and other gases.\nIn the case of steam and water, property variations \n(specific heat and thermal conductivity) can be significant \nover the ranges of temperature and pressure found in \nboilers. It is therefore recommended that the properties \nas compiled in the American Society of Mechanical \nEngineers (ASME) Steam Tables6 be used.\nRadiation properties\nBodies that are good radiation absorbers are equally \ngood emitters and Kirchhoff’s law states that, for gray \nsurfaces at thermal equilibrium, their emissivities are \nequal to their absorptivities. A blackbody is one which \nabsorbs all incident radiant energy while reflecting or \ntransmitting none of it. The absorptivity and emissivity \nof a blackbody are, by definition, each equal to one. This \nterminology does not necessarily mean that the body \nappears to be black. Snow, for instance, absorbs only \na small portion of the incident visible light, but to the \nlonger wavelengths (the bulk of thermal radiation), snow \nis almost a blackbody. At a temperature of 2000F (1093C) \na blackbody glows brightly because a non-negligible part \nof its emitted radiation is in the visible range. Bodies are \nnever completely black, but a hole through the wall of a \nlarge enclosure can be used to approximate blackbody \nconditions because radiation entering the hole undergoes \nmultiple reflections and absorptions. As a result, most of \nthe radiation is retained in the enclosure, and surfaces \nare treated as gray. \nFortunately, a number of commercial surfaces, \nparticularly at high temperatures, have emissivities of \n0.80 to 0.95 and behave much like blackbodies. Typical \naverage emissivity values are noted in Table 9. Although \nemissivity depends on the surface composition and \nroughness and wavelength of radiation, the wavelength \ndependence is often neglected in practical boiler calcula­\ntions and surfaces are treated as gray.\nAsh deposits  The emittance and thermal properties \nof furnace ash deposits have a large effect on boiler heat \ntransfer. The emittance depends on the temperature, \nchemical composition, structure and porosity of the \nparticulate layer, and whether deposits are partially fused \nor molten. The same ash at different locations within the \nsame boiler (or the same location in different boilers) may \nhave significantly different values of surface emittance. \nReported values in the literature claim emittances \nbetween 0.5 and 0.9 for most ash and slag deposits.\nThe effect of coal ash composition, structure, and \ntemperature on deposit emittance5,7 is shown in Fig. 8. \nA friable particulate material has low emittance because \nradiation is scattered (and reflected) from individual \nparticles and does not penetrate beyond a thin layer (~1 \nmm) near the surface. Emittance of friable ash deposits \ndecreases with increasing surface temperature until \nsintering and fusion changes the structure of the deposit. \nA sharp increase in emittance is associated with ash fu­\nsion as particles grow together (pores close) and there are \nfewer internal surfaces to scatter radiation.

Water vapor \nand carbon dioxide are important in boiler calculations \nbecause of their presence in the combustion products of \nhydrocarbon fuels. These gases are selective radiators. \nThey emit and absorb radiation only in certain bands \n(wavelengths) of the spectrum that lie outside of the visible \nrange and are consequently identified as nonluminous \nradiators. Whereas the radiation from a furnace wall \nis a surface phenomenon, a gas radiates and absorbs \n(within its absorption bands) at every point throughout \nthe furnace. Furthermore, the emissivity of a gas changes \nwith temperature, and the presence of one radiating gas \nmay have characteristics that overlap with the radiating \ncharacteristics of another gas when they are mixed. The \nenergy emitted by a radiating gaseous mixture depends \non gas temperature, the partial pressures, p, of the \nconstituents and a beam length, L, that depends on the \nshape and dimensions of the gas volume. An estimate of \nthe mean beam length is L = 3.6 V/A for radiative transfer \nfrom the gas to the surface of the enclosure, where V is \nthe enclosure volume and A is the enclosure surface area. \nThe factor 3.6 is approximate, and values between 3.4 \nto 3.8 have been recommended depending on the actual \ngeometry.4\nFigs. 9 and 10 show the emissivity for water vapor and \ncarbon dioxide.8 The accuracy of these charts has gained \ngreater acceptance than the more widely known charts of \nHottel,4 particularly at high temperatures and short path \nlengths. The effective emissivity of a water vapor-carbon \ndioxide mixture is calculated as follows:\n\t\n\t\n(41)\nwhere De is a correction factor that accounts for the effect \nof overlapping spectral bands. This equation neglects \npressure corrections and considers boilers operating \nat approximately 1 atm. The factors shown in Fig. 11 \ndepend on temperature, the partial pressures, p, of the \nconstituents and the beam length, L. The presence of \ncarbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide can typically be \nneglected in combustion products because CO and SO2 \nare weakly participating and overlap with the infrared \nspectrum of H2O and CO2. \nWhen using Figs. 9 to 11 to evaluate absorptivity, a, of \na gas, Hottel4 recommends modification of the pL product \nby a surface-to-gas temperature ratio. This is illustrated \nin Example 6 at the end of this chapter.\nRadiation properties of gases can be calculated more \naccurately based on fundamental models for spectral gas \nradiation. The exponential wide band model9 predicts \nspectral absorption and emission properties of single- and \nmulti-component gases including H2O, CO2, CO, CH4, \nNO, and SO2 as a function of temperature and pressure. \nDiatomic gases N2, O2 and H2 may contribute to the \ntotal gas volume and pressure of the mixture, but are \nconsidered transparent to infrared radiation.

Particles are introduced as the fuel which undergo \ntransformations of combustion and/or are formed by the \nprocesses of condensation and agglomeration of aerosol \nparticles. Entrained particles have a significant role in \nradiation heat transfer because they absorb, emit and \nscatter radiation.

(See Numerical methods.)\nMie Theory10 is a general method for calculating the \nradiation properties of spherical particles as a function \nof particle composition, concentration, diameter and \nwavelength. Rigorous calculations by this method can \nonly be performed with the aid of a computer and require \nthat optical properties (complex refractive index as a func­\ntion of wavelength) of the particle materials are known. \nThe complex refractive index of lignite, bituminous, and \nanthracite coals, and corresponding properties of char \nand ash have been measured, as well as other materials \nthat are typically encountered in combustion systems. \nRadiation properties of particles are conveniently \nexpressed as total emission, absorption and scattering \nefficiencies that depend on particle composition, diameter \nand temperature. Particle properties must be combined \nwith gas properties in an analysis of radiation with \nparticipating media.\nWorking Formulas for Convection \nHeat Transfer\nHeat transfer by convection between a fluid (gas \nor liquid) and a solid is expressed by Equation 4. This \nequation is a definition of the heat transfer coefficient but \nis inadequate in describing the details of the convective \nmechanisms. Only a comprehensive study of the flow and \nheat transfer would define the dependence of the heat \ntransfer coefficient along the surface. In the literature, \nsimple geometries have been modeled and predictions \nagree well with experimental data. However, for the \nmore complex geometries encountered in boiler analysis, \ncorrelations are used that have been developed principally \nfrom experimental data.\nConvective heat transfer near a surface takes place by \na combination of conduction and mass transport. In the \ncase of heat flowing from a heated surface to a cooler fluid, \nheat flows from the solid first by conduction into a fluid \nelement, raising its internal energy. The heated element \nthen moves to a cooler zone where heat flows from it by \nconduction to the cooler surrounding fluid.\nFluid motion can occur in two ways. If the fluid is \nset in motion due to density differences arising from \ntemperature variations, free or natural convection occurs. \nIf the motion is externally induced by a pump or fan, the \nprocess is referred to as forced convection.\nConvective heat transfer can occur in laminar or \nturbulent flows. For laminar flow, the fluid moves in \nlayers, or lamina, with each element following an orderly \npath. In turbulent flow, prevalent in boiler passages, \nthe local motion of the fluid is chaotic and statistical \ntreatment is used to establish average velocity and heat \ntransfer values.\nExperimental studies have confirmed that a flow field \ncan be divided into two zones: a viscous zone adjacent to \nthe surface and a nonviscous zone removed from the heat \ntransfer surface. The viscous, heated zone is termed the \nboundary layer region. The hydrodynamic boundary layer \nis defined as the distance from the wall at which the local \nvelocity reaches 99% of the velocity far from the wall.\nAt the entrance of a pipe or duct, the boundary layer \nbegins to grow; this flow portion is called the developing \nregion. Downstream, when the viscous region fills the \npipe core or grows to a maximum, the flow is termed fully \ndeveloped. Developing region heat transfer coefficients \nare larger than the fully developed values. In many ap­\nplications it is sufficient to assume that the hydrodynamic \nand thermal boundary layers start to grow at the same \nlocation, although this is not always the case.\nFlow over a body (around a circular cylinder) is termed \nexternal flow, while flow inside a confined region, like a \npipe or duct, is termed internal flow.\nNatural or free convection\nA fluid at rest, exposed to a heated surface, will be \nat a higher temperature and lower density than the \nsurrounding fluid. The differences in density, because \nof this difference in temperature, cause the lighter, \nwarmer fluid elements to circulate and carry the heat \nelsewhere. The complex relationships governing this \ntype of convective heat transfer are covered extensively \nin other texts.1 Experimental studies have confirmed \nthat the main dimensionless parameters governing free \nconvection are the Grashof and Prandtl numbers:\n\t\n\t\n(42)\n\t\n\t\n(43)\nThe Grashof number is a ratio of the buoyant to viscous \nforces. The Prandtl number is the ratio of the diffusion \nof momentum and heat in the fluid.

Studies of many heat transfer systems and \nnumerical simulation of some simple geometries confirm \nthat fluid flow and heat transfer data may be correlated \nby dimensionless numbers. Using these principles, scale \nmodels enable designers to predict field performance. For \nsimple geometries, a minimum of dimensionless numbers \nis needed for modeling. More complex scaling requires \nmore dimensionless groups to predict unit performance.\nThe Reynolds number is used to correlate flow and \nheat transfer in closed conduits. It is defined as:\n\t\n\t\n(45)\nwhere L is a characteristic length of the conduit or an \nobstacle in the flow field. This dimensionless group \nrepresents the ratio of inertial-to-viscous forces. \nThe Reynolds number is only valid for a continuous \nfluid filling the conduit. The use of this parameter gener­\nally assumes that gravitational and intermolecular forces \nare negligible compared to inertial and viscous forces.\nThe characteristic length, termed equivalent hydraulic \ndiameter, is different for circular and noncircular \nconduits. For circular conduits, the inside diameter (ID) \nis used. For noncircular ducts, the equivalent diameter \nbecomes:\n\t\n\t\n(46)\nThis approach, used to compare dynamically similar \nfluids in geometrically similar conduits of different size, \nyields equal Reynolds numbers for the flows considered.\nAt low velocities, the viscous forces are strong and \nlaminar flow predominates, while at higher velocities, \nthe inertial forces dominate and there is turbulent flow. \nIn closed conduits, such as pipes and ducts, the transition \nto turbulent flow occurs near Re = 2000. The generally \naccepted range for transition to turbulent flow under \ncommon tube flow conditions is 2000 < Re < 4000.\nFor fluid flow over a flat external surface, the \ncharacteristic length for the Reynolds number is the \nsurface length in the direction of the flow, x. Transition \nto turbulence is generally considered for Re ≥ 105. In the \ncase of flow perpendicular to a cylinder (or tube), the \noutside diameter (OD), D, is the characteristic length. In \ntube bundles with crossflow, transition generally occurs \nat Re > 100.\nExperimental studies have confirmed that the \nconvective heat transfer coefficient can be functionally \ncharacterized by the following dimensionless groups:\n\t\n\t\n(47)\nwhere Nu is the Nusselt number, Re is the Reynolds \nnumber and Pr is the Prandtl number.\nThe Nusselt number, a ratio of the wall temperature \ngradient to reference gradients, is defined as follows:\n\t\n\t\n(48)\nRe =\n=\nρ\nµ\nµ\nV L\nGL\nDe =\n×\n4\nFlow cross-sectional area\nWetted perimeter\nNu =\n(\n)\nf Re, Pr\nNu = hL\nk\nThe previously discussed Prandtl number, representing a \nratio of the diffusion of momentum and heat in the fluid, \nis also the ratio of the relative thickness of viscous and \nthermal boundary layers. For air and flue gases, Pr < \n1.0 and the thermal boundary layer is thicker than the \nviscous boundary layer.\nIn the literature, correlations are also presented using \nother dimensionless groups; the Peclet and Stanton \nnumbers are the most common. The Peclet number is \ndefined as follows:\n\t\n\t\n(49)\nThe Stanton number is defined in terms of the Nusselt, \nReynolds and Prandtl numbers:\n\t\n\t\n(50)\nLaminar flow inside tubes  For heating or cooling of \nviscous fluids in horizontal or vertical tubes with constant \nsurface temperature and laminar flow conditions (Re < \n2300), the heat transfer coefficient, or film conductance, \ncan be determined by the following equation:11\n\t\n\t\n(51)\nor\n\t\n\t\n(52)\nwhere the parameter G = rV is defined as the mass flux \nor mass flow rate per unit area, and tube diameter, D, \nis the characteristic length used in the evaluation of the \nReynolds number. The ratio of viscosities (mb /m w) is a \ncorrection factor that accounts for temperature dependent \nfluid properties. Properties in Equations 51 and 52 are \nevaluated at an average bulk fluid temperature, except \nmw which is evaluated at the wall temperature.\nFor low viscosity fluids, such as water and gases, a \nmore complex equation is required to account for the \neffects of natural convection at the heat transfer surface. \nThis refinement is of little interest in industrial practice \nbecause water and gases in laminar flow are rarely \nencountered.\nTurbulent flow  Studies of turbulent flow indicate \nseveral well defined regions as shown in Fig. 12. Next \nto the heat transfer surface is a very thin laminar flow \nregion, less than 0.2% of the characteristic length, where \nthe heat flow to or from the surface is by molecular conduc­\ntion. The next zone, known as the buffer layer, is less \nthan 1% of the characteristic length and is a mixture of \nlaminar and turbulent flow.

In the \nturbulent core, which comprises roughly 98% of the \ncross-section, heat is transferred mainly by convection.\nIn turbulent flow, the local but chaotic motion of the \nfluid causes axial and radial motion of fluid elements. \nThis combination of motions sets up eddies, or local swirl­\ning motions, augmenting the heat transfer from the core \nto the laminar sublayer. The laminar flow in the sublayer \nand the laminar component in the buffer layer act as a \nbarrier, or film, to the heat transfer process. Increasing \nthe fluid velocity has been found to decrease this film \nthickness, reducing the resistance to heat transfer. \nTurbulent flow in tubes  The distance required to \nobtain hydrodynamically and thermally fully developed \nturbulent flow is shorter than that for laminar flow. \nThe flow length needed to achieve hydrodynamically \nfully developed conditions is variable and depends upon \nthe specific Reynolds number (operating conditions) \nand surface geometry. It typically varies from 6 to 20 \ndiameters (x/D). Fully developed thermal flow for gases \nand air, important in boiler analysis, occurs at similar \nx/D ratios. However, for liquids, the ratio is somewhat \nhigher and increases with the Prandtl number.\nExtensive research data using low viscosity gases and \nliquids have been correlated.

{"chunk_id": "unit_001_page_022", "page_number": 22, "text": "4-22\nSteam 42 / Heat Transfer\nThe Babcock & Wilcox Company\nheat transfer mechanisms depend, however, on various \nfactors including porosity of the material, gas density and \ncomposition filling the voids, temperature gradient across \nthe material, and absolute temperature of the material.\nAnalytical evaluation of the separate mechanisms is com-\nplex, but experimental studies at B&W have shown that \nthe effective conductivity can be approximated by: \n\t\n\t\n(75)\nExperimental data can be correlated through this form, \nwhere a, b and c are correlation coefficients. The heat flow \nis calculated using Equation 1; k is replaced by keff and T \nis the local temperature in the insulation.\nIn high temperature applications, heat transfer across \nthe voids occurs mainly by radiation and the third term of \nEquation 75 dominates. In low temperature applications, \nheat flow by conduction dominates and the first two terms \nof Equation 75 are controlling.\nFilm condensation\nWhen a pure saturated vapor strikes a surface of lower \ntemperature, the vapor condenses and a liquid film is \nformed on the surface. If the film flows along the surface \nbecause of gravity alone and a condition of laminar flow \nexists throughout the film thickness, then heat transfer \nthrough this film is by conduction only. As a result, the \nthickness of the condensate film has a direct effect on \nthe quantity of heat transferred. The film thickness, in \nturn, depends on the flow rate of the condensate. On a \nvertical surface, because of drainage, the thickness of the \nfilm at the bottom will be greater than at the top. Film \nthickness increases as a plate surface is inclined from \nthe vertical position.\nAs the film temperature increases, its thickness \ndecreases primarily due to increased drainage velocity. \nIn addition, the film thickness decreases with increasing \nvapor velocity in the direction of drainage.\nMass diffusion and transfer\nHeat transfer can also occur by diffusion and mass \ntransfer. When a mixture of a condensable vapor and a \nnoncondensable gas is in contact with a surface that is \nbelow the dew point of the mixture, some condensation \nk\na\nbT\ncT\neff =\n+\n+\n3\noccurs and a film of liquid is formed on the surface. \nAn example of this phenomenon is the condensation of \nwater vapor on the outside of a metal container. As vapor \nfrom the main body of the mixture diffuses through the \nvapor-lean layer, it is condensed on the cold surface as \nshown in Fig. 29. The rate of condensation is therefore \ngoverned by the laws of gas diffusion. The heat transfer \nis controlled by the laws of conduction and convection.\nThe heat transferred across the liquid layer must \nequal the heat transferred across the gas film plus the \nlatent heat given up at the gas-liquid interface due to \ncondensation of the mass transferred across the gas film. \nAn equation relating the mass transfer is:\n\t\n\t\n(76)\nwhere T and Y define the temperatures and concentra­\ntions, respectively, identified in Fig. 29, hd is the heat \ntransfer coefficient across the liquid film, hg is the heat \ntransfer coefficient across the gas film, and Ky is the mass \ntransfer coefficient. Hfg is the latent heat of vaporization.\nHeat transfer due to mass transfer is important in \ndesigning cooling towers and humidifiers where mixtures \nof vapors and noncondensable gases are encountered.\nEvaporation or boiling\nThe phenomenon of boiling is discussed in Chapters \n1 and 5, where the heat transfer advantages of nucleate \nboiling are noted. Natural circulation fossil fuel boilers \nare designed to operate in the boiling range. In this range, \nthe heat transfer coefficient varies from 5000 to 20,000 \nBtu/h ft2 F (28,392 to 113,568 W/m2 K). This is not a \nlimiting factor in the design of fossil fuel boilers provided \nscale and other deposits are prevented by proper water \ntreatment, and provided the design avoids critical heat \nflux (CHF) phenomena. (See Chapter 5.)\nIn subcritical pressure once-through boilers, water is \ncompletely evaporated (dried out) in the furnace wall tubes \nwhich are continuous with the superheater tubes. These \nunits must be designed for subcooled nucleate boiling, \nnucleate boiling, and film boiling, depending on fluid \nconditions and expected maximum heat absorption rates.\nFluidized-bed heat transfer\nThe heat transfer in gas-fluidized particle beds \nused in some combustion systems is complex, involving \nh\nT\nT\nh\nT\nT\nK H\nY\nY\ni\ng\ng\ni\ny\nfg\ng\ni\nδ\nδ\n−\n(\n) =\n−\n(\n) +\n−\n(\n)\nFig. 29  Simultaneous heat and mass transfer in the dehumidification \nof air.\nFig. 28  Coefficient Y as a function of ratio R/r for fin efficiency.\n", "char_count": 4618, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_4", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Heat Transfer", "is_complete_section": true}}

Although empirical \nmethods and extensive equipment testing continue to \nprovide information to designers, numerical simulation \nof boiler components, e.g., membrane walls, will become \nincreasingly important as computer technology continues \nto evolve. (See Chapter 6.)\nConduction\nThe energy equation for steady-state heat flow was \npreviously defined as Equation 19 and is more generally \nwritten as Equation 20. Solutions of these equations \nfor practical geometries are difficult to obtain except \nin idealized situations. Numerical methods permit the \nconsideration of additional complex effects including \nirregular geometries, variable properties, and complex \nboundary conditions. Conduction heat flow through \nboiler membrane walls, refractory linings with various \nmaterials, and steam drum walls are several applications \nfor these methods. The approach is to divide the heat \ntransfer system into subvolumes called control volumes. \n(See Fig. 30.) (References 16 and 17.) The governing equa-\ntion is integrated, or averaged, over the subvolume, \nleading to an expression of the form:\n\t\n\t\n(77)\nwhere the subscripts denote the neighbor locations as \npoints on a compass.

Equation 77 is a \ndiscrete form of the continuous differential equation given \nin Equation 21. The modeled geometry is subdivided and \nequations of this form are determined for each interior \nvolume. The electrical analogy of the equation is appar­\nent. First, each term is an expression of heat flow into \na point using Fourier’s law by Equation 1, and second, \nKirchhoff’s law for electrical circuits, Equation 26, is \nused to determine the net flow of heat into any point. The \napplication of the electrical analogy is straightforward \nfor any interior volume once the subvolumes are defined. \nAt the boundaries, temperature or heat flow is defined.\nFor unsteady-state problems, a sequence of solutions is \nobtained for the time interval Dt, with T o\np being the node \ntemperature at the beginning of the interval and Tp being \nthe temperature at the end of the interval. References 16 \nand 17 explore these models in depth. Various computer \ncodes are commercially available to perform the analysis \nand display the results. \nRadiation\nNumerical methods provide accurate estimates \nof radiative transfer in the absorbing and scattering \nmedia that is ubiquitous in the combustion and post-\ncombustion zones of a boiler. Many numerical methods \nhave the advantage of incorporating complex geometrical \ndescription of the enclosure walls. These methods solve \nthe radiation transport equation (RTE) in two and three \ndimensions and include the effects of absorption, emission \nand scattering media, for gray or nongray enclosure \nwalls. Numerical models start by dividing the volume and \nsurfaces of an enclosure into multiple control volumes and \nsurface elements (as described in Chapter 6). Radiation \nproperties of gases and particles are evaluated at each \ncontrol volume, and may vary with local composition \nand temperature of the combustion mixture. Emissivity \nand temperature of the walls may also vary with local \nconditions for each surface element of the enclosure. The \nsolution of the RTE is generally carried out for the entire \nradiative spectrum for greatest numerical efficiency. \nHowever, if increased accuracy is required, the spectrum \ncan be divided into discrete bands corresponding with \nthe bands of gaseous radiation and the RTE is solved for \neach band separately. \nRadiative heat transfer in furnaces can be calculated \nby one of several numerical methods, which are described \nin Reference 10. The simplest of these is the zonal method,4\nan extension of the network exchange method described \npreviously in this chapter. The enclosure is divided into \na finite number of isothermal volume and surface area \nzones. Exchange factors for all combinations of volume-\nto-volume, volume-to-surface, and surface-to-surface \nexchange are precalculated. This analysis leads to a set \nof simultaneous equations for unknown radiant heat \nfluxes, which are solved numerically.\nThe discrete ordinates method is perhaps the most \nrobust approach for numerical analysis of radiation heat \ntransfer in boilers. The angular dependence of radiation \nis first expressed in spherical coordinates, and is divided \ninto a finite number of discrete directions for solving \nthe RTE.

The accuracy of the \nmethod increases with the number of directions that are \nused in the approximation (typically 12, 24 or 48). The \ndiscrete ordinates method was developed and optimized \nfor thermal radiation in multi-dimensional geometries by \nthe pioneering work at B&W.18  Since then, it has gained \nin popularity, and is now used in many commercial \ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes.\nThe numerical solution for radiation leads to the \ndistribution of radiant intensity or radiant heat flux, \nfor a given temperature field. This solution is coupled to \nthe energy equation and temperature of the gas-particle \nmixture. The energy equation (Equation 28 or 29) can \nbe solved numerically for gas-particle temperature field \nusing the methods described in Chapter 6. Radiation \nabsorption and emission is represented by the internal \nheat generation term, SH. Wall temperature is determined \nfrom an energy balance for convection and radiation heat \ntransfer to the surface, and heat conduction through the \nwall. Several iterations between radiation, gas-particle \nenergy, and wall temperature will ultimately yield a \nconverged solution in which an overall energy balance \nis achieved.\nDesign Considerations\nFurnaces\nFossil fuel-fired boiler designers need to evaluate \nfurnace wall temperature and heat flux, flue gas \ntemperature, and furnace exit gas temperature. These \nparameters are required to determine materials and their \nlimits, and to size heat transfer surfaces. \nAn analytical solution for heat transfer in a steam \ngenerating furnace is extremely complex. It is not possible \nto calculate furnace outlet temperatures by theoretical \nmethods alone. Nevertheless, this temperature must be \ncorrectly predicted because it determines the design of \nthe superheater and other system components.\nIn a boiler, all of the principal heat transfer mecha­\nnisms take place simultaneously. These mechanisms are \nradiation between combustion gases, suspended solid \nparticles, tubes, and refractory materials; convection \nfrom the gases to the furnace walls; and conduction \nthrough ash deposits on tubes.\nVariations caused by fuel type are significant. \nPulverized coal, gas, oil or waste-fuel firing may be used. \nIn addition, different types of the same fuel also cause \nvariations. Coal, for example, may be high volatile or \nlow volatile, and may have high or low ash and moisture \ncontents. The ash fusion temperature may also be high \nor low, and may vary considerably depending on whether \nfurnace atmosphere is oxidizing or reducing.\nFurnace geometry is complex. Variations occur in \nthe burner locations and spacing, in the fuel bed size, in \nthe ash deposition, in the type of cooling surface, in the \nfurnace wall tube spacing, and in the arch and hopper \narrangements. Flame shape and length also affect the \ndistribution of radiation and heat absorption in the \nfurnace.\nHigh intensity, high mixing burners produce bushy \nflames and promote large high temperature zones in the \nlower furnace. Lower intensity, controlled mixing burners \nusually have longer flames that delay combustion while \ncontrolling pollutant formation. Staged combustion with \noverfire air ports provides greater benefits for controlling \nnitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions, but produces a further \ndelay in combustion and a corresponding small increase \nin unburned combustion loss.\nSurface characteristics vary. The enclosing furnace \nwalls may include any combination of fuel arrangements, \nrefractory material, studded tubes, spaced tubes backed \nby refractory, close-spaced tubes, membrane construction \nor tube banks. Emissivities of these surfaces are different. \nThe water-cooled surface may be covered with fluid slag \nor dry ash in any thickness, or it may be clean.\nTemperature varies throughout the furnace. Fuel \nand air enter at relatively low temperatures, reach high \ntemperatures during combustion, and cool again as the \nproducts of combustion lose heat to the furnace enclosure. \nAll temperatures change with load, excess air, burner \nadjustment and other operating conditions.\nAccurate estimates of furnace exit gas temperature \nare important. For example, high estimates may lead \nto over estimating the heat transfer surface, while low \nestimates may cause operational problems. These are \ndiscussed in Chapter 19.\nEmpirical methods  Considering the fuel type, firing \nrate and furnace configuration, empirical methods as \nillustrated in Fig. 31 have long been used to predict local \nabsorption rates in the furnace. These methods, although \nlargely empirical, contain engineering models which are \nbased on fundamentals. Data and operating experience \nare used to tune the models employed in the design \nenvelope. Fig. 31 shows typical vertical and horizontal \nheat flux distributions for furnace walls. \nDeviations in the heat flux distribution are caused by \nunbalanced firing, variations in tube surface condition, \ndifferences in slagging, load changes, sootblower opera­\ntion and other variations in unit operation. A typical upset \nheat flux distribution is shown in Fig. 31. These upset \nfactors are typically a function of vertical/horizontal loca­\ntion, firing method and fuel, and furnace configuration. \nThey are derived from operating experience.\nStaged combustion with overfire air ports causes a \nsignificant shift in furnace heat release and heat flux \ndistribution. Compared to unstaged combustion shown \nin Fig. 31, heat fluxes are lower in the burner zone and \nthe peak heat flux is shifted to a higher elevation just \nabove the overfire air ports.\nThe heat flux applied to the tubes in the furnace wall \nis also nonuniform in the circumferential direction. As \nshown in Fig. 32, the membrane wall is exposed to the \nfurnace on one side while the opposite side is typically \ninsulated to minimize heat loss. The resulting heat flux \ndistribution depends upon the tube outside diameter, wall \nthickness, and spacing, as well as the web thickness and \nmaterials. The fluid temperature and inside heat transfer \ncoefficient have secondary effects. This distribution can \nbe evaluated using commercially available computer \ncodes.\nTo correlate data and calculations for different \nfurnaces, methods for comparing the relative effective­\nness of different furnace wall surfaces are needed. \nThe effectiveness and spacing of tubes compared to a \ncompletely water-cooled surface are shown in Fig. 33. \n", "char_count": 6534, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_4", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Heat Transfer", "is_complete_section": true}}

Relative magnitudes of convective \nand radiative heat transfer at various locations are \nshown in Fig. 39 for a 650 MW boiler.

{"chunk_id": "unit_002_page_028", "page_number": 28, "text": "4-28\nSteam 42 / Heat Transfer\nThe Babcock & Wilcox Company\nminimized for the most effective heat transfer. However, \nthis optimum tube diameter may require an arrangement \nthat is expensive to fabricate, difficult to install, or \ncostly to maintain. A compromise between heat transfer \neffectiveness and manufacturing, erection and service \nlimitations is therefore necessary in selecting tube \ndiameter. \nPenetration of radiation  A convection bank of tubes \nbordering a furnace or a cavity acts as a blackbody \nradiant heat absorber. Some of the impinging heat, \nhowever, radiates through the spaces between the tubes \nof the first row and may penetrate as far as the fourth \nrow. The quantity of heat penetration can be established \nby geometric or analytical methods. The effect of this \npenetration is especially important in establishing tube \ntemperatures for superheaters located close to a furnace \nor high temperature cavity. Consider 2.0 in. (50.8 mm) \nOD tubes placed in an array of tubes on a 6.0 in. (152.4 \nmm) pitch. Fig. 33, curve 1 can be used to estimate the \nremaining radiation. For a given radiant heat flux, 45% \nis absorbed in the first tube row, and 55% passes to the \nsecond row. 45% of this reduced amount is again absorbed \nin the second tube row. After the fourth row, less than \n10% of the initial radiation remains.\nEffect of lanes  Lanes in tube banks, formed by \nthe omission of rows of tubes, may decrease the heat \nabsorption considerably. These passages act as bypasses \nfor flowing hot gases and radiation losses. Although the \noverall efficiency decreases, the high mass flow through \nthe lanes increases the absorption rate of the adjacent \ntubes. Critical tube temperatures in superheaters \nor steaming conditions in economizers may develop. \nWhenever possible, lanes should be avoided within tube \nbanks and between tube banks and walls; however, this \nis not always possible. A calculation accounting for the \nlanes is necessary in such cases.\nHeat transfer to water\nWater heat transfer coefficient  The heat transfer \ncoefficient for water in economizers is so much higher \nthan the gas-side heat transfer coefficient that it can be \nneglected in determining economizer surface.\nBoiling water heat transfer coefficient  The combined \ngas-side heat transfer coefficient (convection plus \nintertube radiation) seldom exceeds 30 Btu/h ft2 F (170 \nW/m2 K) in boiler design practice. The heat transfer \ncoefficient for boiling water [10,000 Btu/h ft2 F (56,784 W/\nm2 K)] is so much larger that it is generally neglected in \ncalculating the resistance to heat flow, although Equation \n4 in Chapter 5  can be used to calculate this value.\nEffect of scale  Water-side and steam-side scale \ndeposits provide high resistance to heat flow. As scale \nthickness increases, additional heat is required to \nmaintain a given temperature inside a furnace tube. \nThis leads to high metal temperatures and can cause \ntube failure. Deposition of scale and other contaminants \nis prevented by good feedwater treatment and proper \noperating practices.\nHeat transfer to steam  In superheaters, the steam-\nside convection constitutes a significant resistance \nto heat flow. Although this resistance is much lower \nthan the gas-side resistance, it cannot be neglected in \ncomputing the overall heat flow resistance or the heat \ntransfer rate. It is particularly significant in calculating \nsuperheater tube temperatures because the mean tube \nwall temperature is equal to the steam temperature plus \nthe temperature drop through the steam film plus half \nof the metal temperature drop.\nThe steam-side heat transfer coefficient is calculated \nfrom Equation 58 using information from Figs. 13, 16 and \n17. If the steam heat transfer coefficient is designated \nas h, the film temperature drop, DTf, is q/(hA), using \nthe outside surface area of the tube as the base in each \nexpression.\nIt is imperative to prevent scale deposits in superheater \ntubes. Because of its high resistance to heat flow and due \nto the elevated temperatures, even a thin layer of scale \nmay be sufficient to overheat and fail a tube.\nCavities\nCavities are necessary between tube banks of steam \ngenerating units for access, for sootblowers, and for \npossible surface addition. Hot flue gas radiates heat to the \nboundary surfaces while passing through the cavity. The \nfactors involved in calculating heat transfer in cavities \nare as follows. \nTemperature level  Radiation from gases to boundary \nsurfaces and radiation to the gas by the surroundings \nincrease approximately by the fourth power of their \nrespective absolute temperatures. Remembering that Eb \n= sT 4, Equations 39 and 40 illustrate this relationship.\nGas composition  Carbon dioxide and water vapor \nare the normal constituents of flue gases which emit \nradiation in steam generating units. The concentrations \nof these constituents depend on the fuel burned and the \namount of excess air.\nParticles in the gas  The particles carried by flue \ngases receive heat from the gas by radiation, convection \nand conduction, and emit heat by radiation to the furnace \nenclosure.\nSize of cavity  The heat transfer rate increases \nwith cavity size. Thick layers of gas radiate more vigor­\nously than thin layers. The shape of the cavity can also \ncomplicate heat transfer calculations.\nReceiving surface  A refractory surface forming \npart of a cavity boundary reaches a high temperature \nby convection and radiation from the flue gas. It also \nreradiates heat to the gas and to the other walls of the \nenclosure. Reradiation from a clean, heat-absorbing \nsurface is small unless the receiving surface temperature \nis high, as is the case with superheaters and reheaters. \nAsh or slag deposits on the tube reduce heat absorption \nand increase reradiation.\nIn boiler design, there are two significant effects of \ncavity radiation: 1) the temperature of flue gas drops, \nfrom several degrees up to 40F (22C), in passing across a \ncavity, and 2) gas radiation increases the heat absorption \nrates for the tubes forming the cavity boundaries. The \nsecond effect influences superheater tube temperatures \nand the selection of alloys.\nInsulation\nThe calculation of heat transfer through insulation \nfollows the principles outlined for conduction through a \ncomposite wall.

If the \ninner face of the furnace wall is refractory, the hot face \ninsulation temperature must be calculated using radia­\ntion and convection heat transfer principles on the gas side \nof the furnace wall, or estimated using empirical data.\nHeat loss and cold face temperature  The heat loss to \nthe surroundings and the cold face temperature decrease \nas the insulation thickness increases. However, once \nan acceptable layer of insulation is applied, additional \namounts are not cost effective. Standard commercial \ninsulation thicknesses should be used in the composite \nwall.\nThe detailed calculation of overall heat loss by \nradiation and convection from the surfaces of a steam \ngenerating unit (usually called radiation loss) is tedious \nand time consuming. A simple approximate method \nis provided by the chart prepared from the American \nBoiler Manufacturers Association (ABMA) original. (See \nChapter 23, Fig. 13.)\nAmbient air conditions  Low ambient air tempera-\nture and high air velocities reduce the cold face temp-\nerature. However, they have only a small effect on total \nheat loss because surface film resistance is a minor part \nof the total insulation resistance. Combined heat loss \nrates (radiation plus convection) are given in Chapter \n23, Fig. 12, for various temperature differences and air \nvelocities. The effect of surface film resistance on casing \ntemperature and on heat loss through casings is shown \nin Chapter 23, Fig. 16.\nTemperature limits and conductivities  Refractory \nor insulating material suitable for high temperature \napplications is usually more expensive and less effective \nthan low temperature materials. It is therefore customary \nto use several layers of insulation. The lower cost, more \neffective insulation is used in the cool zones; the higher \ncost materials are used only where demanded by high \noperating temperatures. Thermal conductivities for \nrefractory and insulating materials, and temperatures for \nwhich they are suitable, are shown in Chapter 23, Fig. 11.\nApplications\nExample 1 – Conduction through a plane wall\nIf a flat plate is heated on one side and cooled on the \nother, the heat flow rate in the wall, shown in Fig. 1, is \ngiven by Equation 2. The rate of heat flow through a 0.25 \nin. thick steel plate with 1 ft2 surface area and DT = 25F \nmay be evaluated with Equation 2 as follows:\n\t\n\t\n(78)\nwhere the thermal conductivity, k, for steel is 30 Btu/h ft F.\nExample 2 – Heat flow in a composite wall \nwith convection\nThe heat flow through a steel wall which is insulated \non both sides is shown in Fig. 3. This example demon­\nstrates the procedure for combining thermal resistances. \nIn addition to the thermal resistance of the firebrick, \nsteel and insulation, the heat flow is impeded by the \nq\nk A\nT\nL\n=\n=\n×\n×\n=\n∆\n30\n1\n25\n0 25 12\n36 000\n.\n/\n,\nBtu/h\nsurface resistances. Consider a 600 ft2 surface with \nradiating gases at 1080F  on the inside exposed to an \nambient temperature of 80F on the outside. The thermal \nconductivities of the firebrick, steel flue and insulation \nare assumed to be k1 = 0.09, k2 = 25, and k3 = 0.042 Btu/h \nft F, respectively. These assumptions are verified later. \nThe layer thicknesses are Dx1 = 4 in., Dx2 = 0.25 in., and \nDx3 = 3 in. The heat transfer coefficients for convection \nare hcv,i = 5.0 Btu/h ft2 F on the inside surface and hcv,o = \n2.0 Btu/h ft2 F on the outside surface. The resistances in \nTable 4 for rectangular geometries can be used. Where \nthe temperature difference between the radiating gas, \nTg, and a surface, T1, is small, the radiation heat transfer \ncoefficient can be approximated by:\n\t\n\t\n(79a)\nwhere Tg and Ts are the absolute temperatures, R (K). \nIn this example, the surface emissivity is assumed close \nto 1.0 resulting in:\n\t\n\t\n(79b)\nUsing the Req shown in Fig. 3 and values of R evaluated \nusing Table 4:\n\t\n\t\n(80)\nIt is clear that the firebrick and insulation control the \noverall resistance; the steel resistance can be neglected. If \nthe successive material layers do not make good thermal \ncontact with each other, there will be interface resistances \ndue to the air space or film. These resistances may be \nneglected in composite walls of insulating materials. \nHowever, they must be included in calculations if the \nlayer resistances are small compared to the interface \nresistances. An example of this is heat transfer through \na boiler tube with internal oxide deposits.\nThe heat flow can be computed using Equation 23:\n\t\n\t\n(81)\nTo determine if the correct thermal conductivities \nwere assumed and if the temperature levels are within \nallowable operating limits of the material, it is necessary \nto calculate the temperatures at the material interfaces. \nSolving Equation 81 for temperature and substituting \nindividual resistances and local temperatures:\nh\nT\nT\nT\nr\ng\ng\n≅\n+\n(\n)\n\n\n≈\n4 0\n2\n4\n1\n3\n3\n.\n/\nσ ε\nσ ε\nhr =\n×\n(\n)\n+\n(\n)\n=\n−\n4 0 0 1713 10\n1080\n460\n25\n8\n3\n.\n.\nBtu/h ft F\n2\nR A\neq\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n=\n1\n5\n1\n25\n1\n5\n1\n25\n4\n12\n0 09\n0 25\n12\n25\n3\n12\n0 042\n1\n2\n.\n.\n.\n0 033\n3 70\n0 000833\n5 95\n0 5\n10 18\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n+\n+\n+\n+\n=\nh ft F\nBtu\n2\nq\nT\nT\nR\nA T\nT\nR\nA\ng\neq\ng\neq\n=\n−\n=\n−\n=\n−\n\n\n\n=\n∞\n∞\n600 1080\n80\n10 18\n58 939\n.\n,\nBtu\nh\n", "char_count": 5358, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_002", "section_id": "chapter_27", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Convection banks", "is_complete_section": true}}
