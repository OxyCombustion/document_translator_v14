Most petroleum \nis refined to some extent before use, although small \namounts are burned without processing. Originally, \nrefining petroleum was simply the process of separating \nthe lighter compounds, higher in hydrogen, from the \nheavier compounds by fractional distillation. This \nyielded impure forms of kerosene, gasoline, lubricating \noils and fuel oils. Through the development of refining \ntechniques, such as thermal cracking and reforming, \ncatalytic reforming, polymerization, isomerization and \nhydrogenation, petroleum is now regarded as a raw \nmaterial source of hydrogen and carbon elements that \ncan be combined as required to meet a variety of needs.\nIn addition to hydrocarbons, crude oil contains \ncompounds of sulfur, oxygen and nitrogen, and traces of \nvanadium, nickel, arsenic and chlorine. Processes are \nused during petroleum refinement to remove impurities, \nparticularly compounds of sulfur. Purification processes \nfor petroleum products include sulfuric acid treatment, \nsweetening, mercaptan extraction, clay treatment, \nhydrogen treatment and the use of molecular sieves.\nThe refining of crude oil yields a number of products \nhaving many different applications. Those used as fuel \ninclude gasoline, distillate fuel, residual fuel oil, jet \nfuels, still gas, liquefied gases, kerosene and petroleum \ncoke. Products for other applications include lubricants \nand waxes, asphalt, road oil and petrochemical \nfeedstock.\nFuel oils for steam generation consist primarily of \nresidues from the distillation of crude oil. As refinery \nmethods improve, the quality of residual oil available for \nutility and industrial steam generation is deteriorating. \nHigh sulfur fuels containing heavy components create \nchallenges during combustion that range from high \nparticulate and  emissions to higher maintenance costs \ndue to the corrosive constituents in the flue gas.\nChapter 11\nOil and Gas Utilization\nTransportation, storage and handling\nThe high heating value per unit of volume of oil, its \nvaried applications, and its liquid form have fostered a \nworldwide system of distribution. The use of supertank­\ners for the transportation of crude oil has significantly \nreduced transportation costs and has allowed refineries \nto be located near centers of consumption rather than \nadjacent to the oil fields. Ultra large crude carriers \n(ULCC) weighing 320,000 to 550,000 t (290,560 to \n499,400 tm), are capable of transporting up to 3,100,000 \nbbl (492,900 m3) of crude oil at a time to deepwater ports.\nTanker and barge shipments on coastal and inland \nwaterways are by far the least expensive method of \ntransporting the various grades of oil. With the depletion \nof oil fields in the eastern United States (U.S.), crude oil \ntrunk lines were developed in the early 1900s to transport \noil from points west of the Mississippi River to the east \ncoast refineries. Today, more than 170,000 mi (274,000 \nkm) of pipeline, including small feeder lines, are used for \nthe transportation of oil within the U.S. Much smaller \nquantities of oil are shipped over land by rail and truck \nbecause of the higher cost of haulage.\nFuel oil systems require either underground or surface \nstorage tanks. Oil is usually stored in cylindrical shaped \nsteel tanks to eliminate evaporation loss. Loss in storage \nof the relatively nonvolatile heavy fuel oils is negligible. \nLighter products, such as gasoline, may volatilize suf­\nficiently in warm weather to cause appreciable loss. In \nthis instance, storage tanks with floating roofs are used \nto eliminate the air space above the fuel where vapors \ncan accumulate. The National Fire Protection Association \n(NFPA) has prepared a standard set of codes for the \nstorage and handling of oils (NFPA 30 and 31). These \ncodes serve as the basis for many local ordinances and \nare required for the safe transportation and handling of \nfuel products.\nExtensive piping and valving and suitable pumping \nand heating equipment are necessary for the transporta­\ntion and handling of fuel oil. Storage tanks, piping and \nheaters for heavy oils should be cleaned periodically \nbecause of fouling or sludge accumulation.\nFuel properties\nSafe and efficient transportation, handling and \ncombustion of fuel oil requires a knowledge of fuel \ncharacteristics. Principal physical properties of fuel oils, \nimportant to boiler applications, are summarized below. \n(See Chapter 9 for typical fuel oil physical property values.)\n", "char_count": 4976, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_11", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Oil and Gas Utilization", "is_complete_section": true}}
{"chunk_id": "unit_001_page_002", "page_number": 2, "text": "11-2\nSteam 42 / Oil and Gas Utilization\nThe Babcock & Wilcox Company\nViscosity  The viscosity of an oil is the measure of \nits resistance to internal movement, or flow. Viscosity is \nimportant because of its effect on the rate at which oil \nflows through pipelines and on the degree of atomization \nobtained by oil-firing equipment.\nUltimate analysis  An ultimate analysis is used to \ndetermine theoretical air requirements for combustion \nof the fuel and also to identify potential environmental \nemission characteristics.\nHeating value  The heating value of a liquid fuel is \nthe energy produced by the complete combustion of one \nunit of fuel [Btu/lb (J/kg)]. Heating value can be reported \neither as the gross or higher heating value (HHV) or the \nnet or lower heating value (LHV). To determine HHV, it \nis assumed that any water vapor formed during combus­\ntion is condensed and cooled to the initial temperature \n(i.e., all of the chemical energy is available). The heat \nof vaporization of the water formed is included in the \nHHV. For LHV, it is assumed that the water vapor does \nnot condense and is not available. The heating value \ndetermines the quantity of fuel necessary to achieve a \nspecified heat input.\nSpecific gravity  Specific gravity (sp gr) is the ratio \nof the density of oil to the density of water. It is important \nbecause fuel is purchased by volume, in gallons (l) or \nbarrels (m3). The most widely used fuel oil gravity scale is \ndegree API devised by the American Petroleum Institute; \nits use is recommended by the U.S. Bureau of Standards \nand the U.S. Bureau of Mines. The scale is based on the \nfollowing formula:\n[sp gr at 60/60F (16/16C) means when both oil and \nwater are at 60F (16C)]\t\nFlash and fire point  Flash point is the lowest temper-\nature at which a volatile oil will give off explosive or \nignitable vapors. It is important in determining oil \nhandling and storage requirements. The fire point is the \ntemperature to which a liquid must be heated to produce \nvapors sufficient for continuous burning when ignited by \nan external flame.\nPour point  The pour point is the temperature at which\na liquid fuel will first flow under standardized conditions.\nDistillation  Distillation determines the quantity \nand number of fractions which make up the liquid fuel.\nWater and sediment  Water and sediment are a \nmeasure of the contaminants in a liquid fuel. The sedi­\nment normally consists of calcium, sodium, magnesium, \nand iron compounds. Impurities in the fuel provide an \nindication of the potential for plugging of fuel handling \nand combustion equipment.\nCarbon residue  Residue that remains after a liquid \nfuel is heated in the absence of air is termed carbon \nresidue. The tests commonly used to determine carbon \nresidue are the Conradson Carbon Test and the Ramsbot­\ntom Carbon Test. Carbon residue gives an indication of \nthe coking tendency of a particular fuel (i.e., the tendency \nof oil, when heated, to form solid compounds).\nAsphaltene content  Asphaltenes are long chain, \nhigh molecular weight hydrocarbon compounds. The \nasphaltene content of a petroleum product is the percent­\nage by weight of wax-free material insoluble in n-heptane \nbut soluble in hot benzene. Their structure requires high \ntemperatures and high atomization energy for the fuel to \nburn completely. Higher asphaltene content indicates a \nhigher potential to produce particulate emissions.\nBurning profile  Burning profile is a plot of the rate \nat which a sample of fuel burns under standard conditions \nas temperature is increased at a fixed rate. The burning \nprofile is a characteristic fingerprint of the fuel oxidized \nunder standard conditions and is not intended to provide \nabsolute kinetic and thermodynamic data. It helps \nevaluate combustion characteristics of various fuels on a \nrelative basis to determine excess air and residence time \nnecessary for complete combustion.\nNatural Gas  \nPreparation\nNatural gas, found in crude oil reservoirs, either \ndissolved in the oil or as a gas cap above the oil, is called \nassociated gas. Natural gas is also found in reservoirs \nthat contain no oil and is termed non-associated gas.\nNatural gas, directly from the well, must be treated to \nproduce commercially marketable fuels. Initially, natural \ngas undergoes a process to remove condensate which \nis distilled to produce butane, propane and stabilized \ngasoline. Propane and butane are widely used as bottle \ngas. They are distributed and stored liquefied under \npressure. When the pressure is released, the liquid boils, \nproducing a gaseous fuel.\nNatural gas may contain enough sand or gaseous \nsulfur compounds to be troublesome. The sand is usually \nremoved at the source. Natural gas containing excessive \namounts of hydrogen sulfide, commonly known as sour \ngas, can be treated by a process known as sweetening. \nSweetening removes hydrogen sulfide as well as carbon \ndioxide. Additional treatments include the removal of \nmercaptan by soda fixation and the extraction of long \nchain hydrocarbons.\nWhere natural gas is used to replace or supplement \nmanufactured gas, it is sometimes reformed to bring its \nheating value in line with the manufactured gas. Natural \ngas may also be mixed directly with manufactured gas to \nincrease the heating value of the final product.\nTransportation, storage and handling\nPipelines are an economical means of transporting \nnatural gas in its gaseous form. The rapid increase in \nconsumption of natural gas in areas far from the source \nhas resulted in an extensive system of long distance \npipelines. Natural gas can also be transported by \ntanker when liquefied under pressure to produce liquefied \nnatural gas (LNG).\nThe distribution of natural gas is subject to some \npractical limitations because of the energy required for \ntransportation. High pressures, about 1000 psig (6895 \nkPa), are necessary for economic pipeline transportation \nover long distances. Compression stations are needed at \nspecified intervals to boost the pressure due to losses in \nthe line.\nIn general, it is not practical to vary the supply of \n", "char_count": 6113, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_11", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Oil and Gas Utilization", "is_complete_section": true}}

For economic reasons, long \ndistance pipelines operate with a high load factor. The \nrate of withdrawal from the wells may often be limited \nfor conservation reasons, and the cost of the pipeline to \nprovide the peak rate would be prohibitive. Therefore, to \nmeet fluctuations in demand, it is usually necessary to \nprovide local storage or to supplement the supply with \nmanufactured gas for brief periods.\nStorage methods above ground include: 1) large water \nseal tanks, 2) in-pipe holders laid parallel to commercial \ngas lines, and 3) using the trunk transmission line as a \nreservoir by building up the line pressure. In consumer \nareas where depleted or partially depleted gas and oil \nwells are available, underground storage of gas pumped \nback into these wells provides, at minimum cost, the large \nstorage volume required to meet seasonal variations in \ndemand. In liquid form, natural gas can be stored in \ninsulated steel tanks or absorbed in a granular substance, \nand later released into gaseous form by passing warm \ngas over the grains.\nFuel properties\nNatural gas is comprised primarily of methane and \nethane. Physical properties of practical importance \nto boiler applications include constituents by volume \npercent, heating value, specific gravity, sulfur content \nand flammability. (See Chapter 9 for typical natural gas \nphysical property values.)\nOther Liquid and Gaseous Fuels \nNumerous combustion system applications utilize \nliquid or gaseous fuels other than conventional fuel oils \nor natural gas. These fuels include blast furnace gas, \ncoke oven gas, refinery gas, regenerator offgas, landfill \ngas, and other byproduct gases.\nThe large heavy hydrocarbon and bitumen reserves \navailable in Venezuela have led to the creation of a \nbitumen oil emulsion fuel, known as Orimulsion, that has \ngained acceptability. Orimulsion fuel is a natural bitumen \ndispersed in water, in approximately a 70/30 proportion \nsplit. The resulting emulsion is stabilized by a surfactant \npackage. Orimulsion fuel can be transported over land or \nwater and stored for extended periods while maintaining \na consistent quality. Although it can be handled using \nmost of the equipment and systems originally designed \nfor heavy fuel oil, Orimulsion fuel requires some special \nhandling and combustion considerations because of its \nemulsified state. In addition, although the fuel exhibits \nvery good combustion characteristics, it contains rela­\ntively high levels of sulfur, nitrogen, ash, asphaltenes, \nvanadium and other metals. Thus, careful design and \ncleanup considerations are important when firing a fuel \nwith high levels of these constituents.\nSteel mill blast furnaces generate a byproduct gas con­\ntaining about 25% carbon monoxide (CO) by volume. This \nfuel can be burned to produce steam for mill heating and \npower applications. Many mills also have their own coke \nproducing plant, another source of byproduct fuel. Coke \noven gas is an excellent fuel that burns readily because of \nits high free hydrogen content. With these gases, available \nsupply pressures and the volumetric heating value of fuel \nmay be different from that of natural gas. Therefore, gas \nhandling and combustion components must be designed \nto accommodate the particular characteristics of the gas \nto be burned.\nIn the petroleum industry, refinery gas and regen­\nerator offgas are frequently used as energy sources for \nboilers. Refinery gas is a mixture of gaseous hydrocarbon \nstreams from various refinery processes. Depending \non economic and technical considerations within the \nrefinery, the compositions of these individual streams \nvary with process modifications and thus, the resultant \nrefinery gas can change over time. Combustion equipment \nand controls for refinery gas must be suitably designed for \nthis variability. Regenerator offgas, or CO gas, is a high \ntemperature gas produced in catalytic cracking units. \nCO boilers have been developed to reclaim the thermal \nenergy present in this gas. (See Chapter 27.)\nLandfill gas is a combustible gas recovered by a gas \ncollection system at a landfill. Its primary constituents \nare methane and carbon dioxide. Landfill gas processing \nsystems filter suspended particulates and condensate \nfrom the gas stream. Additional processing may be done \nto further purify the gas, but trace contaminants that \ntypically remain in the gas require special attention when \ndesigning fuel handling systems to minimize corrosion \nconcerns.\nOil and Gas Combustion — System Design \nThe burner is the principal component for the \ncombustion of oil and natural gas. (See Fig. 1.) In utility \nand industrial steam generating units (both wall- and \ncorner-fired designs), the burner admits fuel and air to \nthe furnace in a manner that allows safe and efficient \ncombustion, while realizing the full capability of the \nboiler. Burner design determines mixing characteristics \nof the fuel and air, fuel particle size and distribution, and \nsize and shape of the flame envelope.\nThe means of transporting, measuring and regulating \nfuel and air to the furnace, together with the burners, \nigniters and flame safety equipment, comprise the overall \ncombustion system. The following factors should be \nconsidered when designing the combustion system and \nFig. 1  Typical oil and gas utility boiler burner front.\n", "char_count": 5505, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_11", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Oil and Gas Utilization", "is_complete_section": true}}

Control should be simple and \ndirect to allow rapid response to varying load demands.\nCombustion air is typically conveyed to the burners by \nforced draft fans. To improve both thermal and combustion \nefficiency and further ensure burner stability, combustion \nair is normally preheated to a temperature of 400 to 600F \n(204 to 316C) by air heaters located downstream of the \nfans. The fans should be capable of delivering adequate \nquantities of air for complete combustion at a pressure \nsufficient to overcome losses across the air heaters, \nburners, control dampers and intervening duct work. \nThe total combustion air is the amount of air required to \ntheoretically burn all the fuel plus excess air necessary \nfor complete combustion. (See Chapter 10.)\nThe fuel delivery system must be able to regulate fuel \npressure and flow to the burners and must be safeguarded \nin accordance with applicable fire protection codes. Proper \ndistribution of fuel to the burners, in multiple burner \napplications, is one factor to consider for safe and efficient \noperation of the combustion system. Piping and valves \nmust be designed for allowable velocity limits, absolute \npressure requirements, and pressure losses. \nPerformance Requirements\nExcess air\nExcess air is the air supplied for combustion and \ncooling of idle burners in excess of that theoretically \nrequired for complete oxidation of the fuel. Excess air is \ngenerally required to compensate for imperfections in \nthe air delivery system which result in maldistribution \nof combustion air to the burners. Excess air also helps \ncompensate for imperfect mixing of the air and fuel in the \nfurnace. At full load, with all burners in service, excess \nair required for gas and oil firing, expressed as a percent \nof theoretical air, is typically in the range of 5 to 10%, \ndepending upon fuel type and the requirements of the \ncombustion system. Operation at excess air levels below \nthese values is possible if combustion efficiency does not \ndeteriorate. Combustion efficiency is measured in terms \nof CO, unburned combustibles in the ash, soot, particulate \nmatter and stack opacity. Through careful design of the \nburners and the air delivery system, excess air can be \nheld to a minimum, thereby minimizing sensible heat \nloss to the stack.\nOperation at partial load requires additional excess \nair. When operating with all burners in service at reduced \nload, lower air velocity at the burners results in reduced \nmixing efficiency of the fuel and air. Increasing the excess \nair improves combustion turbulence and maintains \noverall combustion efficiency. Additional excess air \nand improved burner mixing also compensate for lower \nfurnace temperature during partial load operation. In \nsome instances, boiler performance dictates the use \nof higher than normal excess air at reduced loads to \nmaintain steam temperature or to minimize cold end \ncorrosion.\nAdditional excess air is also necessary when operating \nwith burners out of service. Sufficient cooling air must \nbe provided to idle burners to prevent overheat damage. \nPermanent thermocouples installed on burners measure \nmetal temperatures and establish the minimum air \nnecessary to maintain burner temperatures below the \nmaximum use limits of the steel. Excess air for burner \ncooling varies with the percentage of burners out of \nservice.\nStability and turndown\nProper burner and combustion system design will \npermit stable operation of the burners over a wide \noperating range. A stable burner, best determined \nthrough visual observation, is one where the flame front \nremains relatively stationary and the root of the flame \nis securely anchored near the burner fuel element. To \nprovide stable combustion, the burner must be designed \nto prevent blowoff or flashback of the flame for varying \nrates of fuel and air flow.\nIt is often desirable to operate over a wide boiler load \nrange without taking burners out of service. This reduces \npartial load excess air requirements to cool idle burners. \nThe burners should therefore be capable of operating in \na turned down condition. Burner turndown is defined \nas the ratio of full load fuel input to partial load input \nwhile still maintaining stable combustion. Limitations \nin burner turndown are generally dictated by fuel \ncharacteristics, fuel and air velocity, full load to partial \nload fuel pressures, and adequacy of the flame safety \nsystem. Automated and reliable flame safety supervision, \nwith proper safeguards, must be available to achieve high \nburner turndown ratios.\nWith gas firing, a turndown ratio of 10:1 is not uncom­\nmon. Natural gas is easily burned and relatively easy to \ncontrol. Residual oil, on the other hand, is more difficult \nto burn. Combustion characteristics of residual oil are \nhighly sensitive to particle size distribution, excess air \nand burner turbulence. A typical turndown ratio for oil \nis 6:1, depending upon fuel characteristics, flexibility of \nthe delivery system and atomization technique.\nBurner pulsation\nBurner pulsation is a phenomenon frequently associ­\nated with natural gas firing and, to a lesser degree, with \noil firing. Pulsation is thought to occur when fuel rich \npockets of gas suddenly and repeatedly ignite within the \nflame envelope. The resultant pulsating burner flame is \n", "char_count": 6433, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_11", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Oil and Gas Utilization", "is_complete_section": true}}

Combustion rumble may transmit frequencies \nthat coincide with the natural frequency of the furnace \nenclosure resulting in apparent boiler vibration. In some \ninstances, these vibrations may become alarmingly \nviolent.\nBoiler vibration on large furnaces can sometimes be \nattributed to a single burner. Minor air flow adjustment \nto a given burner, or removing select burners from service, \nmay suddenly start or stop pulsations. Pulsation problems \ncan be corrected through changes to burner hardware \nthat affect mixing patterns of the fuel and air. Changes \nto the burner throat profile to correct anomalies in burner \naerodynamics or changes to the fuel element discharge \nports have successfully eliminated pulsation.\nHistorical operating data has enabled the development \nof empirical curves that are useful in designing burners \nto avoid pulsation. These curves relate the potential for \nburner pulsation to the ratio of burner fuel to air velocity. \nTogether with careful consideration of furnace geometry, \nburner firing patterns and burner aerodynamics, prob­\nlems with burner pulsation are becoming less common.\nCombustion efficiency\nMany factors influence combustion efficiency includ­\ning excess air, burner mixing, fuel properties, furnace \nthermal environment, residence time, and particle size \nand distribution. Complete combustion occurs when \nall combustible elements and compounds of the fuel \nare entirely oxidized. In utility and industrial boilers, \nthe goal is to achieve the highest degree of combustion \nefficiency with the lowest possible excess air. Thermal \nefficiency decreases with increasing quantities of excess \nair. Combustion performance is then measured in terms \nof the boiler efficiency loss due to incomplete combustion \ntogether with the efficiency loss due to sensible heat in \nthe stack gases.\nFrom the standpoint of optimum combustion efficiency, \nthe following factors should be considered for proper \ndesign:\n1.\t careful distribution and control of fuel and air to the \nburners,\n2.\t burner and fuel element design that provides thorough \nmixing of fuel and air, and promotes rapid, turbulent \ncombustion, and\n3.\t proper burner arrangement and furnace geometry to \nprovide sufficient residence time to complete chemical \nreactions in a thermal environment conducive to stable \nand self-sustained combustion.\nIn most cases, boiler efficiency loss due to unburned \ncarbon (UBC) loss when firing oil and natural gas is virtu­\nally negligible. However, depending on fuel oil properties \nand the condition of the combustion system, the percent \nUBC loss can be about 0.10% while firing oil. Combustion \nefficiency with these fuels is usually measured in terms of \nCO emissions, particulate emissions and stack opacity. All \nof these emissions are directly related to the combustion \nsystem design and associated required nitrogen oxides \n(NOx) emission limits. Numerous techniques are available \nand should be factored into the final design to achieve \nlow NOx emissions while maintaining acceptable CO, \nparticulate and opacity levels.\nEmission Control Techniques\nEver increasing concern over atmospheric emissions \nis changing the focus of wall- and corner-fired boiler and \ncombustion system designs. Federal and local regulations \nare currently in place that limit oxides of nitrogen, oxides \nof sulfur, particulate matter, stack opacity and other \nhazardous air pollutants. Additional regulations are also \nbeing proposed. While emission limits vary depending \nupon state and local regulations, the trend is toward more \nstringent control. (See Chapter 32.) \nMany combustion control techniques have emerged to \nreduce fossil fuel emissions. These techniques generally \nfocus on the reduction of NOx, as changes to the combus­\ntion process can greatly influence NOx formation and \ndestruction.\nNitrogen oxides \nNitrogen oxides in the form of NO and NO2 are formed \nduring combustion by two primary mechanisms: thermal \nNOx and fuel NOx. A secondary mechanism called prompt \nNOx can also contribute to overall NOx formation. (See \nChapter 33.)\nThermal NOx results from the dissociation and \noxidation of nitrogen in the combustion air. The rate \nand degree of thermal NOx formation is dependent upon \noxygen availability during the combustion process and is \nexponentially dependent upon combustion temperature. \nThermal NOx reactions occur rapidly at combustion \ntemperatures in excess of 2800F (1538C). Thermal NOx \nis the primary source of NOx formation from natural gas \nand distillate oils because these fuels are generally low \nin or devoid of fuel-bound nitrogen.\nFuel NOx, on the other hand, results from oxidation of \nnitrogen organically bound in the fuel and is the primary \nsource of NOx formation from heavy fuel oil. Fuel bound \nnitrogen in the form of volatile compounds is intimately \ntied to the fuel hydrocarbon chains. For this reason, \nthe formation of fuel NOx is linked to both fuel nitrogen \ncontent and fuel volatility. Inhibiting oxygen availability \nduring the early stages of combustion, where the fuel \ndevolatilizes, is an effective means of controlling fuel \nNOx formation.\nPrompt NOx is formed during the early, low tem­\nperature stages of combustion. Hydrocarbon fragments \nmay react with atmospheric nitrogen under fuel-rich \nconditions to yield fixed nitrogen species. These, in turn, \ncan be oxidized to NO in the lean zone of the flame. In \nmost flames, especially those from nitrogen-containing \nfuels, the prompt mechanism is responsible for only a \nsmall fraction of the total NOx.\nTotal NOx emissions are strongly dependent on \nburner design when firing oil or natural gas. Conventional \nburners promote rapid mixing of the fuel and air which \ngenerate high amounts of thermal and fuel NOx. However, \nlow NOx burners are capable of NOx reductions by virtue \nof carefully controlled mixing of air and fuel. The XCL-S® \nlow NOx oil/gas burner developed by The Babcock & \nWilcox Company (B&W) is described in more detail \nlater in this chapter. Low NOx burners can be used in \ncombination with the other techniques described below \nto achieve the lowest possible NOx emissions.\nNumerous combustion process NOx control techniques \nare commonly used. These vary in effectiveness and cost. \n", "char_count": 6402, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_002", "section_id": "chapter_5", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Emission Control Techniques", "is_complete_section": true}}

A \nrange of typical anticipated NOx emission levels relative \nto various NOx control mechanisms is shown in Fig. 2.\nLow excess air  Low excess air (LEA) effectively re-\nduces NOx emissions with little, if any, capital expendi­\nture. LEA is a desirable method of increasing thermal \nefficiency and has the added benefit of inhibiting thermal \nNOx. If burner stability and combustion efficiency are \nmaintained at acceptable levels, lowering the excess \nair may reduce NOx by as much as 5 to 15% from an \nuncontrolled baseline. The success of this method depends \nlargely upon fuel properties and the ability to carefully \ncontrol fuel and air distribution to the burners. Operation \nmay require more sophisticated methods of measuring \nand regulating fuel and air flow to the burners and \nmodifications to the air delivery system to provide equal \ndistribution of combustion air to all burners.\nBurners out of service  Essentially a simple form of \ntwo-stage combustion, burners out of service (BOOS) is \na simple and direct method of reducing NOx emissions. \nWhen removing burners from service in multiple burner \napplications, active burner inputs are typically increased \nto maintain load. Without changing total air flow, \nincreased fuel input to the active burners results in a fuel \nrich mixture, effectively limiting oxygen availability and \nthereby limiting both fuel and thermal NOx formation. \nAir control registers on the out of service burners remain \nopen, essentially serving as staging ports.\nWhile fairly significant NOx reduction is possible \nwith this method, lower NOx is frequently accompanied \nby higher levels of CO in the flue gas and boiler back-end \noxygen (O2) imbalances. With oil firing, an increase in \nparticulate emissions and increased stack opacity are \nlikely. Through trial and error, some patterns of burners \nout of service may prove more successful than others. \nA limiting factor is the ability of existing burners to \nhandle the increased input necessary to maintain full \nload operation. Short of derating the unit, changes to fuel \nelement sizes may be required.\nTwo-stage combustion  Two-stage combustion is a \nrelatively long standing and accepted method of achieving \nsignificant NOx reduction. Combustion air is directed \nto the burner zone in quantities less than that required \nto theoretically burn the fuel, with the remainder of \nthe air introduced through overfire air (OFA) ports, or \nNOx ports. By diverting combustion air away from the \nburners, oxygen concentration in the lower furnace is \nreduced, thereby limiting the oxidation of chemically \nbound nitrogen in the fuel. By introducing the total \ncombustion air over a larger portion of the furnace, peak \nflame temperatures are also lowered.\nAppropriate design of a two-stage combustion system \ncan reduce NOx emissions by as much as 50% and simul­\ntaneously maintain acceptable combustion performance. \nThe following factors should be considered in the overall \ndesign of the system.\n1.\t Burner zone stoichiometry  The fraction of theoretical \nair directed to the burners is predetermined to allow \nproper sizing of the burners and OFA ports. Normally \na burner zone stoichiometry in the range of 0.85 to 0.90 \nwill result in desired levels of NOx reduction without \nnotable adverse effects on combustion stability and \nturndown.\n2.\t OFA port design  OFA ports should be designed for \nthorough mixing of air and combustion gases in the \nsecond stage of combustion. Ports should have the \nflexibility to regulate flow and air penetration to \npromote mixing, both near the furnace walls and \ntoward the center of the furnace. Mixing efficiency \nshould be maintained over the anticipated boiler load \nrange and the range in burner zone stoichiometries.\n3.\t Burner design  Burners should have the ability to \noperate at lower air flow rates and velocities without \ndetriment to combustion stability. In a two-stage \ncombustion system, burner zone stoichiometry is \ntypically increased with decreasing load to maintain \nburner air velocities above minimum limits. This \nalso provides positive windbox-to-furnace differential \npressures at reduced loads for all burners.\n4.\t OFA port location  Sufficient residence time from \nthe burner zone to the OFA ports and from the ports \nto the furnace exit is a factor to consider for proper \nsystem design. OFA ports should be located to optimize \nNOx reduction and combustion efficiency and to limit \nchange to furnace exit gas temperatures.\n5.\t Furnace geometry  Furnace geometry influences \nburner arrangement and flame patterns, residence \ntime and thermal environment during the first and \nsecond stages of combustion. Liberal furnace sizing \nis generally favorable for lower NOx as combustion \ntemperatures are lower and residence times are \nincreased.\n6.\t Air flow control  Ideally, OFA ports are housed in a \ndedicated windbox compartment. In this manner, air \nto the ports can be metered and controlled separately \nfrom air to the burners. This permits operation at \ndesired stoichiometric levels in the lower furnace and \nallows for compensation to the flow split as a result of \nair flow adjustments to individual burners or OFA ports.\nAdditional flexibility in controlling burner fuel and air \nflow characteristics is required to optimize combustion \nunder a two-stage system. Improved burner designs have \naddressed these needs. \nIn the reducing gas of the lower furnace, sulfur in \nthe fuel forms hydrogen sulfide (H2S) rather than sulfur \ndioxide (SO2) and sulfur trioxide (SO3). The corrosiveness \nof reducing gas and the potential for increased corrosion \nof lower furnace wall tubes is highly dependent upon \nFig. 2  Approximate NOx emission reductions for oil and gas burners \nusing various control techniques.

Two-stage combustion is therefore \nnot normally recommended when firing high sulfur \nresidual fuel oils except when extra furnace wall protec­\ntion measures are included.\nFlue gas recirculation  Flue gas recirculation (FGR)\nto the burners is instrumental in reducing NOx emis­\nsions when the contribution of fuel nitrogen to total \nNOx formation is small. For this reason, the use of gas \nrecirculation is generally limited to the combustion of \nnatural gas and fuel oils. By introducing flue gas from \nthe economizer outlet into the combustion air stream, \nburner peak flame temperatures are lowered and NOx \nemissions are significantly reduced. (See Fig. 3.)\nAirfoils can be used to mix recirculated flue gas with \nthe combustion air. Flue gas is introduced in the sides of \nthe secondary air measuring foils and exits through slots \ndownstream of the air measurement taps. This method \nprovides thorough mixing of flue gas and combustion air \nbefore reaching the burners and does not affect the air \nflow metering capability of the foils.\nIn general, increasing the rate of flue gas recirculation \nto the burners results in an increasingly significant NOx \nreduction. Target NOx emission levels and limitations \non equipment size and boiler components dictate the \npractical limit of recirculated flue gas for NOx control. \nOther limiting factors include burner stability and oxygen \nconcentration of the combustion air. Typically, oxygen \ncontent should be maintained at or above 17% on a dry \nbasis for safe and reliable operation of the combustion \nequipment.\nThe expense of a flue gas recirculation system can be \nsignificant. Gas recirculation (GR) fans are required to \nprovide the desired flow quantities at static pressures \ncapable of overcoming losses through the flues, ducts, \nmixing devices and the burners themselves. Additional \ncontrols and instruments are also necessary to regulate \nGR flow to the windbox at desired levels over the load \nrange. In retrofit applications, significant cost is associ­\nated with routing of flues and ducts to permit mixing of \nthe flue gas with combustion air. Also, the accompanying \nincrease in furnace gas weight at full load operation \nmay require modifications to convection pass surfaces \nor dictate changes to standard operating procedures.\nFrom an operational standpoint, the introduction of \nflue gas recirculation as a retrofit NOx control technique \nmust, in virtually all cases, be accompanied by the instal­\nlation of OFA ports. Oil and gas burners, initially designed \nwithout future consideration to FGR, are not properly \nsized to accommodate the increase in burner mass flow \nas a result of recirculated flue gas. The quantity of flue \ngas necessary to significantly reduce NOx emissions will, \nin all likelihood, result in burner throat velocities that \nexceed standard design practices. This, in turn, may \ncause burner instability, prohibitive burner differentials \nand in the case of gas firing, undesirable pulsation. \nTherefore, the installation of OFA ports in conjunction \nwith FGR serves two useful purposes: 1) lower NOx emis­\nsions through two-stage combustion, and 2) a decrease \nin mass flow of air to the burners to accommodate the \nincreased burden of recirculated flue gas.\nWhen employing flue gas recirculation in combination \nwith overfire air, it is desirable to house the OFA ports \nin a dedicated windbox compartment separate from \nthe burners. In this manner, it is possible to introduce \nrecirculated flue gas to the burners only. This permits \nmore efficient use of the GR fans and overall system \ndesign as only that portion of flue gas introduced through \nthe burners is considered effective in controlling NOx \nemissions.\nReburning  Reburning is an in-furnace NOx control \ntechnique that divides the furnace into three distinct \nzones (main, reburn and burnout). By effectively staging \nboth fuel and combustion air, NOx emission reductions \nof 50 to 75% from baseline levels can be achieved. Heat \ninput is spread over a larger portion of the furnace, with \ncombustion air carefully regulated to the various zones \nto achieve optimum NOx reduction.

{"chunk_id": "unit_002_page_008", "page_number": 8, "text": "11-8\nSteam 42 / Oil and Gas Utilization\nThe Babcock & Wilcox Company\nIn reburning, the lower furnace or main burner zone \nprovides the major portion of the total heat input to the \nfurnace. Depending on the percent NOx reduction and \nthe specific combustion system requirements, the main \nzone burners can be designed to operate at less than \ntheoretical air to normal excess air levels. Combustion \ngases from the main burner zone then pass through a \nsecond combustion zone termed the reburn zone. Here, \nburners provide the remaining heat input to the furnace \nto achieve full load operation but at a significantly lower \nstoichiometry. By injecting reburn fuel above the main \nburner zone, a NOx reducing region is produced in the \nfurnace where hydrocarbon radicals from the partially \noxidized reburn fuel strip oxygen from the NO molecules, \nforming nitrogen compounds and eventually molecular \nnitrogen (N2). OFA ports are installed above the reburn \nzone where the remainder of air is introduced to complete \ncombustion in an environment both chemically and \nthermally nonconducive to NOx formation.\nApplication of this technology must consider a number \nof variables. System parameters requiring definition \ninclude: fuel split between the main combustion zone and \nthe reburn zone, stoichiometry to the main and reburn \nburners, overall stoichiometry in the reburn and burnout \nzones of the furnace, residence time in the reburn zone, \nand residence time required above the OFA ports to \ncomplete combustion. An optimum range of values has \nbeen defined for each of these parameters through labora­\ntory tests and field application and is largely dependent \nupon the type of fuel being fired. For example, fuels with \nhigh sulfur contents (Orimulsion fuel or some heavy fuel \noils) are not as suitable in applications where operating \nthe main combustion zone under low sub-stoichiometric \nconditions is required to reduce NOx levels due to corro­\nsion concerns. For these fuels, reburning technology can \nbe effectively used by operating the main zone at higher \nstoichiometries, thus minimizing corrosion concerns \nwhile still achieving good NOx reduction results.\nAlthough implementation of the reburning technology \nadds complexity to operation and maintenance of the \noverall combustion system, it also provides considerable \nemission performance optimization flexibility. In addi­\ntion, higher initial costs for a reburn system as compared \nto other combustion techniques need to be factored into \nthe evaluation process. From an economic standpoint, the \npotential benefits and technical merit of the reburning \nprocess should be commensurate with long-term goals \nfor NOx abatement.\nSulfur oxides\nThe sulfur content of fuel oils can range anywhere \nfrom a fraction of a percent for lighter oils to 3.5% for \nsome residual oils. During the combustion process, sulfur \ncontained in the fuel is converted to either sulfur dioxide, \nSO2, or sulfur trioxide, SO3 (SOx emissions). The control of \nSOx emissions is a key consideration. Sulfur compounds \nin the flue gas can also cause corrosion problems in the \nboiler and downstream equipment.\nSO3 will form sulfuric acid when cooled in the presence \nof water vapor. In addition to corrosion problems, it can \nproduce emissions of acid smut and visible plume opacity \nfrom the stack. SO3 emissions are often controlled during \ncombustion through low excess air operation and can also \nbe reduced by use of magnesium-based fuel additives.\nTechniques to control sulfur oxides during the \ncombustion process have been investigated in laboratory \nand pilot-scale tests with varying degrees of success. \nHowever, the most effective and commercially accepted \nmethod, short of firing low sulfur fuels, is to install flue \ngas cleanup equipment. (See Chapter 34.)\nParticulate matter\nParticulate matter in the form of soot or coke is a \nbyproduct of the combustion process resulting from \ncarryover of inert mineral matter in the fuel and from \nincomplete combustion. Particulate matter becomes \napparent on oil-fired units when fuel oil droplets undergo \na form of fractional distillation during combustion, leav­\ning relatively large carbonaceous particles known as \ncenospheres.\nCenospheres are porous, hollow particles of carbon \nthat are virtually unaffected by further combustion \nin a conventional furnace environment. Cenospheres \ncan also absorb sulfur oxides in the gaseous phase \nand thereby further contribute to the formation of ash \nparticles contaminated with acid.\nParticulate matter from the combustion of fuel oil is, in \nlarge part, a function of the fuel properties. Ash content of \nthe fuel oil plays a significant role in forming submicron \nparticulate emissions. The fuel oil property most closely \nlinked to forming cenospheres during the combustion \nprocess is asphaltene concentration. Asphaltenes are \nhigh molecular weight hydrocarbons that do not vapor­\nize when heated. The combustion of fuel oils high in \nasphaltene content produces a greater quantity of large \nand intermediate size particulate emissions. Carbon \nresidue, commonly determined by the Conradson Carbon \nTest, is also a means of evaluating the tendency to form \nparticulate matter during combustion.\nControl of particulate emissions is often achieved \nthrough proper atomization of the fuel oil and careful \ndesign of the burners and combustion control system to \nprovide thorough and complete mixing of fuel and air. \nLiberal residence time in a high temperature environ­\nment is favorable for complete combustion of fuel and low \nparticulate emissions, although not conducive to low NOx \nemissions. Oil emulsification also has a favorable impact \non reducing particulate emissions. Oil emulsified with \nwater further breaks up individual oil droplets when \nthe water vaporizes during combustion. In addition, \nmany fuel additives are now available to promote carbon \nburnout. These additives are primarily transition metals \nsuch as iron, manganese, cobalt and nickel that act as \ncatalysts for the further oxidation of carbon particles.\nOpacity\nA visible plume emanating from the stack is un­\ndesirable from both a regulatory and public relations \nstandpoint. Stack opacity is controlled in much the same \nmanner as particulate emissions. Careful selection of \nfuels and complete combustion are keys to minimizing \nplume visibility.\nDark plumes are generally the result of incomplete \ncombustion and can be controlled by careful attention to \nthe combustion process and through transition metal-\nbased additives. White plumes are frequently the result \n", "char_count": 6608, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_002", "section_id": "chapter_5", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Emission Control Techniques", "is_complete_section": true}}

Techniques, or operating conditions, effective \nin reducing one form of atmospheric contaminant are \nfrequently detrimental to controlling others or to unit \nperformance. For this reason, hardware design and \ncombustion controls are becoming increasingly complex. \nModern boilers have the added flexibility necessary to \noptimize thermal efficiency and combustion performance \nin conjunction with sound environmental practices.\nBurner Selection and Design\nAs environmental concerns continue to dictate \nboiler and combustion system design, higher standards of \nperformance are imposed on the fuel burning equipment. \nControl techniques to reduce NOx emissions can conflict \nwith proven methods of good combustion performance, \ne.g., time, temperature and turbulence.\nPotential increases in carbon monoxide emissions, \nparticulate emissions, and stack opacity as a result \nof low NOx operation require burners to be capable of \ncontinued reliable mechanical operation and of providing \nthe flexibility necessary to optimize combustion under a \nvariety of operating conditions.\nCircular burner\nShown in Fig. 5, the circular type burner has long \nbeen the standard design for wall-fired oil and gas \napplications. The tangentially disposed air register doors \nof the circular burner provide the turbulence necessary to \nmix the fuel and air and produce short, compact flames. \nThis burner typically operates with high secondary air \nvelocities providing rapid, turbulent combustion for high \ncombustion efficiency. Fuel is introduced to the burner \nin a fairly dense mixture in the center. The direction \nand velocity of the air and dispersion of the fuel result \nin complete and thorough mixing of fuel and air. NOx \nemissions are relatively high unless counter-measures \nare applied.\nXCL-S® burner\nThe XCL-S oil and gas combination burner shown in \nFig. 6 was originally developed to replace the circular \nburner. It not only meets the demand for added flexibility \nand improved control of combustion air flow, but also \nincorporates the necessary design features not available \nwith the circular register to produce low NOx emission \nlevels. Low NOx oil/gas burners include multiple air zones \nto better regulate air supply to the flame. They also \ninclude fuel elements designed to produce fuel rich flame \ncores to inhibit NOx formation. An internal recirculation \nzone (IRZ) is generated by the air register assembly to \ninduce NOx formed in the air rich periphery of the flame \ninto the fuel rich center where it is reduced.\nThe XCL-S burner has two air zones: the inner or \ncore zone and the outer secondary air zone. When firing \nnatural gas or oil, combustion air is introduced to the core \nzone through slots located around the periphery of the \ninner sleeve. An oil impeller or swirler is unnecessary \nwith this burner; control of the flow entering the core \nzone provides stable ignition. The core zone houses the \nmain gas fuel element(s) and the main fuel oil atomizer.\nThe majority of combustion air enters the burner \nthrough the outer air zone. Axially disposed spin vanes \nare located in the outer sleeve to impart swirl to the \ncombustion air. A sliding air damper separately controls \ntotal air to the burner independent of swirl. An air zone \nswirler (AZS) device can also be incorporated into this \nzone to help reduce excess air and associated emission \nlevels. The burner is equipped with a pitot grid, an air \nmeasuring device upstream of the spin vanes. This device \nprovides a relative indication of air flow to each burner \nand, on multiple burner applications, permits balancing \nof air flow from burner to burner. The outer zone also \nhouses the igniter and flame detection equipment.\nBecause it can measure air flow to individual burners \nand regulate total air flow independent of swirl, the \nXCL-S burner provides the added flexibility needed \nwhen employing combustion control techniques aimed at \nreducing NOx emissions. This burner is ideally suited as \nan upgrade to existing circular (or other wall-fired type) \nburners as burner throat pressure part modifications \ncan typically be avoided.\nThis advanced low NOx burner achieves superior \nemission performance in burner-only applications, as \nwell as situations using overfire air and/or flue gas \nrecirculation. In applications using overfire air ports, \nB&W’s Dual Air Zone port provides maximum operating \nflexibility to optimize overall performance. (See Chapter \n14 for more details.)\nCorner-firing system \nThe general theory and configuration for corner firing \nof oil and/or natural gas is the same as that for pulverized \ncoal firing described in Chapter 14.\nFuel and combustion air are introduced and distributed \nin each corner of the furnace through windbox assemblies \nsimilar to that shown in Fig. 7. The general arrangement \nof the windbox for natural gas or oil firing is essentially \nthe same as that for coal firing in that the windbox is \ndivided along its height into alternating compartments of \nfuel and air. For oil firing, a retractable oil gun is inserted \ninto the center air nozzle of each fuel compartment.

However, the use of FGR requires careful \nanalysis as its effects on boiler operation and maintenance \ncosts can be significant.\nFuel oil equipment\nOil for combustion must be atomized into the furnace \nas a fine mist and dispersed into the combustion air \nstream. Proper atomization is important to efficient com­\nbustion and reduced particulate emissions. Atomization \nquality is measured in terms of droplet size and droplet \nsize distribution. High quality atomization occurs when \noil droplets are small, producing high surface-to-volume \nratios and thereby exposing more surface to the combus­\ntion air. A convenient means of expressing and comparing \natomization quality produced by various atomizer designs \nis the Sauter mean diameter (Dsm).

In general, steam assisted atomizers produce a \nhigher quality spray and are more appropriate for low \nNOx applications or where particulate emissions and stack \nopacity are of primary concern. At some installations, \nhowever, the heat balance is such that steam cannot be \nused economically for oil atomization. Another factor to \nconsider is the necessity to conserve boiler feedwater.

This atomizer is simple to \noperate and made with as few parts as possible. Fuel is \nintroduced into ports that discharge tangentially into a \nwhirl chamber. The fuel is spun out of the whirl chamber \nand passes through an orifice into the combustion \nchamber as a well atomized conical spray.

This atomizer is designed to minimize, or elimi­\nnate entirely, the need for changing sprayer plates or the \nnumber of burners in service during normal operation. \nA wide range of operation is possible by maintaining \na high flow through the sprayer plate slots even at \nreduced firing rates. At reduced firing rates, because \nthe quantity of oil supplied is greater than the required \nfiring rate, the excess oil is returned to a low pressure \npoint in the piping system. The required oil pressure at \nthe atomizer must be either 600 or 1000 psig (4.14 or \n6.90 MPa gauge) depending upon fuel, capacity and load \nrange requirements.

As a minimum, dry \nsaturated steam at the specified pressure must be used \nfor fuel oil atomization to avoid the potential for burner \npulsation. Typically, 20 to 40F (11.1 to 22.2C) superheat \nis recommended to avoid such problems. If necessary, \nmoisture free compressed air can be substituted.\nSeveral steam atomizer designs are available in sizes \nup to 300 × 106 Btu/h (87.9 MWt) or about 16,500 lb/h \n(2.08 kg/s) of fuel. Required oil pressure is much lower \nthan for mechanical atomizers. Steam and oil pressure \nrequirements are dependent upon the specific atomizer \ndesign. Maximum oil pressure can be as much as 300 psig \n(2.07 MPa gauge) with steam pressures as high as about \n200 psig (1.38 MPa gauge). The four most common steam \natomizer designs are the Y-jet, Racer, T-jet and I-jet. Each \ndesign is characterized by different operating ranges, \nsteam consumption rates, and atomization quality based \non resultant oil droplet particle size distributions. Fig. \n8 summarizes these various characteristics for each of \nthe atomizers.\nThe Y-jet is designed for a wide firing range without \nchanging the number of burners in service or the size of \nthe sprayer plate. It can be used on any type of boiler with \neither steam or air atomization. Fuel oil and atomizing \nmedium flow through separate channels to the atomizer \nsprayer plate assembly where they mix immediately \nbefore discharging into the furnace. Required oil pressure \nat the atomizer for maximum capacity ranges from 65 to \n90 psig (0.45 to 0.62 MPa gauge). The Y-jet is a constant \ndifferential atomizer design requiring steam pressure to \nbe maintained at 40 psi (0.28 MPa) above the oil pressure \nthroughout the normal operating range. Steam consump­\ntion with this design is approximately 0.1 lb steam/lb oil.\nThe Racer steam atomizer is a refinement of the Y-jet. \nIt was developed primarily for use where high burner \nturndown and low atomizing steam consumption are \nrequired. The Racer name refers to the class of merchant \nship where this atomizer was first used. Required design \noil pressure for maximum capacity is 300 psig (2.07 MPa \ngauge). Steam pressure is held constant throughout the \nload range at 150 psig (1.03 MPa gauge). Atomizing \nsteam consumption at full load is approximately 0.02 lb \nsteam/lb oil.\nThe T-jet and I-jet atomizers also allow a wide range \nof operation without the need for excessive oil pressure. \nThese atomizer designs are unique in that the steam \nand oil are mixed in a chamber prior to discharging \nthrough the sprayer cap. (See Fig. 10.) The rated capac­\nity oil pressure for the T-jet may range from 90 to 110 \npsig (0.62 to 0.76 MPa gauge) depending upon fuel and \ncapacity requirement. The rated capacity oil pressure \nof the I-jet atomizer ranges from 70 to about 170 psig \n(0.48 to 1.17 MPa gauge). Of the constant differential \nvariety, the I-jet and T-jet require a steam pressure of \napproximately 20 to 40 psi (0.14 to 0.28 MPa) above oil \npressure. Steam pressures may be adjusted to obtain \noptimum combustion performance. Steam consumption \nrates vary with these atomizer designs depending upon \nactual operating pressures. The standard design steam \nconsumption rates at full atomizer capacity for the T-jet \nand I-jet are 0.20 and 0.10 lb steam/lb oil, respectively. \nIn general, higher steam consumption rates result in \nimproved atomization quality.\nA disadvantage of the steam atomizer is its consump­\ntion of steam. For a large unit, this can amount to a \nsizable quantity of steam and consequent heat loss to \nthe stack. When the boiler supplies a substantial amount \nof steam for a process where condensate recovery is \nsmall, the additional makeup for the steam atomizer is \ninconsequential. However, in a large utility boiler where \nturbine losses are low and there is little makeup, the use \nof atomizing steam can have a significant effect.\nNatural gas equipment\nFrequently, a natural gas-fired burner is equipped \nwith multiple gas elements which are supplied from a \nsingle manifold. Multiple elements enable good distribu­\ntion of the gas throughout the flame which improves \nperformance. Three common types of gas element \nassemblies available for the combustion of commercial \nhigh Btu natural gas are the variable-mix multi-spud, \nhemispherical multi-spud, and the radial spud. The \nvariable-mix multi-spud gas element was developed \nfor use with the circular type burner. The goal was to \nimprove ignition stability when flue gas recirculation or \ntwo-stage combustion are implemented for NOx control. \nThis design uses a manifold outside the furnace, with a \nnumber of individual gas elements, or spuds, projecting \nthrough the windbox into the throat. The following is a \nlist of the distinctive features of this gas element:\n1.\t Individual gas spuds are removable with the boiler \nin service to enable cleaning or redrilling of the gas \nnozzles as required.\n2.\t Individual spuds can be rotated to orient the discharge \nholes for optimum firing conditions with the burner \nin service.\n3.\t The location of the spud tip, with respect to the burner \nthroat, can be varied to a limited degree for optimum \nfiring conditions.\n4.\t Individual gas spud flame retainers provide added \nstability and are more conducive to lower NOx emissions.\nThis gas element design adds needed flexibility for \noptimizing combustion under a variety of operating \nconditions. With proper selection of control equipment, \nthe operator can change from one fuel to another without \nFig. 9  Mechanical Return Flow oil atomizer assembly.\nOil Supply\nOil Return\nOil Inlet\nOil Return\nSlip Fit\nSprayer Head\nIntermediate Plate\nSprayer Plate\nSupply Fuel Barrel\nReturn Fuel Barrel\nRegulating Rod\nAir Holes\n", "char_count": 5947, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_002", "section_id": "chapter_5", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Emission Control Techniques", "is_complete_section": true}}

Simultaneous firing of \nnatural gas and oil in the same burner is not generally \nrecommended. This can lead to problems with flame \ndevelopment in situations where the fuel streams impinge \non one another.\nThe hemispherical gas element (Fig. 11) was developed \nfor use with the low NOx XCL-S (Fig. 6) and FM-XCL \n(package boiler application version of the XCL-S) burners. \nWith the exception of the flame retainers, the hemispheri­\ncal gas element offers the same features as the variable \nmix element design. This gas element, however, can \nachieve lower NOx emissions by virtue of the tip profile, \ndrilling pattern and location within the burner.\nThe radial spud design consists of a manifold located \ninside the windbox with individual gas elements project­\ning into the burner throat. Unlike the variable mix and \nhemispherical design, the radial spud is not conducive \nto low NOx emissions. Use of the radial spud is reserved \nfor applications where coal and gas are fired in the same \nburner and where stringent NOx emission limits are not \nan issue.\nFor low NOx gas firing capability in a burner that \nmust also be capable of firing pulverized coal, a single, \nhigh-capacity gas element (HCGE) Super Spud is used. \n(See Fig. 12.) The drilling pattern of the Super Spud and \nits location on the axial centerline of the burner inside \nthe coal nozzle promote lower NOx emissions as a result \nof slower mixing of fuel and air. The gas flame associated \nwith the Super Spud tends to be somewhat longer than \ngas flames associated with burners having multiple \nspud configurations. Consequently, burner capacity and \nfurnace size should be appropriately matched. If adequate \nfurnace depth is available, the Super Spud can also be \nused with the low NOx XCL-S and FM-XCL gas or gas/\noil burners to achieve lower NOx emissions than can be \nachieved with hemispherical multi-spuds.\nThe maximum practical limit for gas input per burner \nis approximately 250 × 106 Btu/h (73.3 MWt). Frequently, \nphysical arrangement of the gas hardware is a limiting \nfactor in fuel input capability. With all gas element \ndesigns, the spud tip drilling is determined by adhering \nto empirical curves aimed at eliminating the potential \nfor burner pulsation.

Gas pressure at the \nburner at rated capacity is generally in the range of 8 to \n12 psig (55 to 82 kPa) for multiple spud configurations \nand as high as 20 psig (137 kPa) for the Super Spud. \nIn many respects, natural gas is an ideal fuel since it \nrequires no preparation for rapid and intimate mixing \nwith the combustion air. However, this characteristic of \neasy ignition under most operating conditions has, in \nsome cases, led to operator carelessness and damaging \nexplosions.\nTo provide safe operation, gas flames should remain \nanchored to the gas element discharge ports throughout \nthe full range of allowable gas pressures and air flow \nconditions. Ideally, stable ignition should be possible at \nminimum load with full load air flow through the burner \nand at full load with as much as 25% excess air. With this \nlatitude in air flow, it is not likely that ignition can be \nlost, even momentarily, during upset conditions.\nByproduct gases \nMany industrial applications utilize blast furnace gas, \ncoke oven gas, refinery gas, regenerator offgas, landfill \ngas, or other byproduct gases to produce steam. (See \nChapter 27.) \nSome byproduct gases, such as CO gas, are not of \nsufficient fuel quality to sustain their own flames. In CO \nboilers, supplementary gas and/or oil burners are used to \nraise the temperature of the CO gas to the ignition point \nand to assure complete burning of the combustibles in \nthe CO gas stream. Supplementary fuel burners and CO \ngas ports are positioned to provide thorough mixing and \nto promote rapid, complete combustion.\nXCL-S lean gas burner  The characteristics of some \nbyproduct gases and their available supply pressures need \nspecial burner designs to utilize such fuels. For example, \nlean gases like blast furnace gas, are low in heating value \nand supplied at low pressure. Accordingly, a burner to fire \nblast furnace gas utilizes a nozzle designed for low gas \nvelocity to promote flame stability and to accommodate \na high gas flow rate with minimal pressure drop.\nA variation of the XCL-S burner has been developed \nby B&W to fire blast furnace gas or other similar lean \ngases. Like the basic XCL-S burner, the lean gas burner \n(Fig. 13) has both a core air zone and an outer air zone. \nLean gas is introduced to the furnace through an annular \nzone located between the two air zones. Combustion \noccurs at both an inner and an outer fuel-air interface, \nthereby promoting stable ignition and more rapid and \ncomplete combustion.\nRich fuels, such as natural gas, coke oven gas, or oil \ncan also be burned in the XCL-S lean gas burner. Fuel \nelements for these fuels are located in the core air zone \nto take advantage of the burner’s inherent air staging \neffect for NOx control. By their nature, lean gases have \na relatively low flame temperature and therefore, have \nlow thermal NOx emissions.\nCold Start and Low Load Operation\nCold boiler startup requires firing at low heat input \nfor long periods of time to avoid expansion difficulties \nand possible overheating of superheaters or reheaters. \nSpud Pipe\nSpud Tip\nFlange\nFig. 12  High-capacity gas element (HCGE) Super Spud.\nSprayer Cap (side view)\nSprayer Cap (front view)\n", "char_count": 3352, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_002", "section_id": "chapter_5", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Emission Control Techniques", "is_complete_section": true}}
{"chunk_id": "unit_002_page_015", "page_number": 15, "text": "11-15\nSteam 42 / Oil and Gas Utilization\nThe Babcock & Wilcox Company\nLow pressure [200 psig (1.38 MPa gauge)] boilers without \nsuperheaters may need only about an hour of low load \noperation. Larger high pressure units, however, may \nneed four to six hours for startup. During startup, \ncombustion efficiency is typically poor, especially with \nresidual oils, due largely to low furnace and combustion \nair temperatures.\nLow load operation may also result in poor distribution \nof air to the burners in a common windbox. Low air flow \nand accompanying low windbox-to-furnace pressure \ndifferentials may result in significant stratification \nof air in the windbox and adversely affect combustion \nperformance. Stack effect (see Chapter 25) between the \nbottom and top rows of burners may further alter the \nquantity of air reaching individual burners. At extremely \nlow loads, firing oil or gas, the fuel piping itself can also \nintroduce poor distribution and accordingly affect burner \noperation. For a given supply pressure, some burners may \nhave adequate fuel while others do not receive enough \nfuel for continuous operation.\nThe low ignition temperature and clean burning \ncharacteristics of natural gas make it an ideal fuel for \nstartup and low load operation. However, extreme care \nshould be taken to avoid a momentary interruption in \nthe flame. Large quantities of water are generated by \nthe combustion of gaseous fuels with a high percentage of \nhydrogen. For units equipped with regenerative type air \nheaters, the air heater should not be placed in service until \nthe flue gas temperature to the air heater has reached \n400F (204C). This prevents condensation of water from \nthe flue gas on the air heater surface and subsequent \ntransport of this water to the burners by the combustion \nair. Water in the combustion air may cause loss of ignition.\nFuel oil is potentially more hazardous than gas \nfor startup and low load operation. Although ignition \nstability is generally not a problem, the low temperature \nfurnace environment may result in the accumulation of \nsoot and carbon particles on air heater and economizer \nsurfaces and may also create a visible plume. If deposits \naccumulate over an extended period of time they pose \na fire hazard. To reduce the incidence of fires, some \noperators use sootblowers that blow steam continuously \non the surfaces of regenerative type air heaters as they \nrotate in the flue gas stream.\nWhen oil must be used for startup, the following firing \nmethods are listed in order of preference:\n1.\t Use of dual fluid atomizers and light fuel oil, No. 1 \nor 2, with steam or compressed air as the atomizing \nmedium. This will limit the deposit of carbonaceous \nresidue on boiler back-end surfaces and help minimize \nopacity.\n2.\t Use of dual fluid atomizers with steam atomization \nand fuel oil no heavier than No. 6, heated as required \nfor reduced viscosity and proper atomization.\n3.\t Use of dual fluid atomizers with compressed air as the \natomizing medium and fuel oil no heavier than No. 6, \nheated as required.\nStartup with oil using mechanical atomizers is not \nrecommended due to the inherent lower atomization \nquality. Stationary boilers equipped with mechanical \natomizers for oil firing at loads between 20 and 100% are \ngenerally started up with natural gas or have available \nsome burners containing startup dual fluid atomizers.\nIgniters \nLighting a burner requires an independent source \nof ignition. The igniters used to provide the necessary \nignition energy range from direct ignition electrical \nigniters to automatically spark-ignited oil- or gas-fired \nigniters. Automatically spark-ignited biodiesel fuel-fired \nigniters are also in development.\nWhere manually inserted hand-held torches were \nonce allowed as a source of ignition, current boiler codes \nrequire permanently installed igniters in each burner. \nThese are most often oil- or gas-fired designs that are \nignited by means of high voltage or high energy spark \nignition systems. The capacity of modern igniters can \nreach 10% or more of the main burner. This permits their \nuse in stabilizing the combustion of difficult to burn fuels \nor in providing support ignition for abnormal main fuel \nconditions. Their high input capacity may also be used \nto warm the furnace prior to starting the main burner \nsystem or to synchronize the turbine. Although the igniter \ncapacity is tailored to meet the specific requirements of \nthe burner and flame safety system, a maximum input of \napproximately 25 × 106 Btu/h (7.3 MWt) is typical.\nThe National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) \ncategorizes igniters according to their input capacity \nrelative to the burner input. Class I igniters generally \nprovide 10% or more of the main burner heat release \nand may be operated continuously for support ignition \nwhen required under all boiler conditions. Specifically, \nthe Class I igniter location and capacity will provide suf­\nficient ignition energy to raise any credible combination \nof burner inputs of both fuel and air above the minimum \nignition temperature. Class II igniters generally provide \n4 to 10% of the burner heat release and may be operated \ncontinuously for ignition support under well defined \nboiler conditions.

Most modern utility boilers employ Class I \nigniters to warm the boiler, provide support for difficult \nfuels and/or poor fuel conditions, and to minimize the \ncomplexity of the flame detection system.\nGas provides a reliable and clean burning fuel for \nhigh capacity igniters. Gas igniters may be operated \nwith either natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). \nWhen operated with LPG, it is critical that the LPG \nsupply system provide a reliable, vapor-only flow at the \nrequired rate. Oil-fired igniters may be used with both \ndistillate and residual fuel oils. Light oils are favored as \nthey avoid complexities of oil heating/recirculation, which \ncan impair reliability. Distillate oil can be used with \neither air or steam atomization with air being preferred. \nResidual oil igniters require superheated steam for \noptimum performance.\nGas and oil igniters are available in both fixed and \nretractable designs. Retractable igniters are inserted \nto their firing position for ignition of the main burner \nfuel and then retracted back into the burner when they \nare no longer needed. Retracting the igniter sufficiently \nreduces radiant heat exposure such that cooling air is not \nrequired. Fig. 14 is a B&W CFS® retractable gas igniter. \nAn oil-fired version is also available.\nFixed igniters are permanently positioned in the \nburner throat at the proper location for ignition of the \nmain fuel.

A dedicated supply of \nair is provided to the FPS igniter to improve combustion \nperformance and to cool the igniter when it is out of \nservice.\nIn addition to these fueled igniters, there is a special \nClass III igniter which does not burn fuel. These ignite the \nburner directly with electrical energy. They are usually \nhigh energy, capacitive discharge, spark ignition systems \nsimilar to those that ignite oil- and gas-fired igniters, but \nusually operate with a higher energy level. Direct electric \nignition can be used on oil burners which burn distillate \nand residual fuel oils having specific characteristics. \nDirect ignition of gas burners is recommended only for \nburners with a single gas element. Reliable ignition of \ngas burners having multiple gas elements spread around \nthe burner can often be difficult, resulting in potentially \nhazardous conditions, and is not normally recommended.\nDirect electric ignition spark systems generally \nprovide an ignition energy level of at least 8 joules, with \n10 to 12 joules used in most applications. The small \nspark produced by the direct ignition spark rod should \nbe carefully positioned in the fuel stream to provide rapid \nignition of the fuel upon opening of the burner fuel valve. \nDirect electric ignition spark systems should always be \nretractable.\nSafety Precautions \nNFPA 85 is a standard set of operating codes \n(procedures, interlocks and trips) for the safe and \nreliable operation of gas and oil combustion processes. \nRecommendations of this standard along with governing \nlocal codes and ordinances are followed in the design of \ngas and oil burner systems, burner interlock and trip \nsystems, and burner sequence control systems.\nIn observance of NFPA 85 guidelines, five rules for the \nsafe and reliable operation of gas- and oil-fired combustion \nsystems, whether employing a manual or automatic \ncontrol system, are described below.\n1.\t Oil or gas should never be allowed to accumulate \nanywhere, other than in a tank or in lines that form \npart of the fuel delivery system. The slightest odor of \ngas must be cause for alarm. Steps should be taken \nimmediately to ventilate the area thoroughly and \nlocate the source of the leak.\n2.\t A minimum purge rate air flow not less than 25% \nof full load volumetric air flow must be maintained \nduring all stages of boiler operation. This includes \npre-purging the setting and lighting of the igniters and \nburners until the firing rate air requirement exceeds \nthe purge rate air flow.\n3.\t A spark producing device must be in operation before \nintroducing any fuel into the furnace. The ignition \nsource must be properly placed with respect to the \nburner and must continuously provide a flame or \nspark of adequate size until a stable main flame is \nestablished.\n4.\t A positive air flow through the burners into the \nfurnace and up the stack must be maintained at all \ntimes.\n5.\t Adequate fuel pressure for proper burner operation \nmust be maintained at all times. In the case of oil \nfiring, fuel pressure and temperature must be main­\ntained for proper atomization. In dual fluid atomizer \napplications, adequate steam or air pressure must be \navailable at the atomizer.\nEquipment requirements, sequence of operation, inter­\nlock systems and alarm systems are equally important, \nif not more so, when implementing combustion control \ntechniques to reduce NOx emissions.\nFig. 14  CFS® retractable gas igniter with high energy spark probe.\n", "char_count": 5098, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_002", "section_id": "chapter_5", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Emission Control Techniques", "is_complete_section": true}}
