The gas \ntemperature at which the fume turns to a sticky liquid \nis also liquor chemistry dependent, with higher levels of \nchlorides or potassium compounds being detrimental to \nunit cleanability.\nThe second major cause of plugging is mechanical \ncarryover of smelt, or unburned black liquor, into the \nconvective heat transfer sections of the boiler. This \nmaterial is predominantly made of sodium carbonate \n(Na2CO3), sodium sulfate and sodium sulfide compounds. \nThe cause of this carryover is related to operation of the \nliquor nozzles, oscillators and various air port settings. \nAs previously noted, the black liquor firing equipment \nand air system settings must produce complete in-flight \nor wall drying of the liquor droplets. If this drying occurs \ntoo high above the smelt bed, the less dense droplets \nare entrained in the gas stream and carry over into \nthe convection sections of the boiler. In practice, most \nrecovery boiler plugging results from a combination of \nfume condensation and mechanical carryover.\nRecovery boilers are also subject to aggressive corro­\nsion compared to conventional fossil fuel-fired units due to \nthe presence of corrosive sulfur, chloride and other trace \ncompounds in an elevated temperature environment. The \nKraft recovery boiler also operates in both an oxidizing \nand reducing atmosphere due to the combustion process. \nBecause of these conditions, the floor and lower furnace \nwalls are constructed using one or a combination of \ncorrosion protection systems: metallic spray coatings or \ncarbon steel tubes, high-density pin studs with refractory, \n304L stainless steel tubes, Incoloy® alloy 825 and Inconel® \nalloy 625 composite tubes, and weld overlay of carbon \nsteel tubes.\nSmelt-water reactions\nOne unique and undesirable feature of a Kraft \nrecovery boiler is the possibility of water entering an \noperating furnace through a tube leak or external \nsource, resulting in a smelt-water reaction. A smelt-water \nreaction occurs when water combines with hot or molten \nsmelt, and a violent explosion can and often does result \nin catastrophic damage to the boiler and surrounding \nequipment, as well as injury or death to personnel. This \nconcern has resulted in years of study and testing and has \nprompted enhanced industry standards on unit design, \noperation and maintenance.

With advances in sensor \ntechnology, control hardware and software, steam genera­\ntor design, and support equipment hardware, as well as \nthe requirements for continuous emissions monitoring \n(CEM), efficient operation today means balancing equip­\nment performance, safety requirements and emissions \nmandates. The procedures used to run steam generating \nequipment vary widely depending upon the type of \nsystem, fuel and application. Systems can range from \nsimple and fully automated requiring minimal operator \ninteraction, such as small gas-fired package boilers, to \nthe very complex requiring constant operator attention \nand interaction, such as a large utility plant. There \nare, however, a set of relatively common fundamental \noperating guidelines that safeguard personnel and \noptimize equipment performance and reliability. When \ncombined with equipment-specific procedures, these \nguidelines promote the best possible operations. This \nchapter begins by focusing on general practices applicable \nto large multi-burner fossil fuel-fired natural circulation \nand once-through boilers, though these practices are \nalso generally applicable to most other boiler designs. \nStarting with Operation of Fluidized-Bed Boilers, the \nremaining sections focus on the unique practices for \nseveral important boiler designs.\nBecause of the intimate relationship between \nequipment design and operation, additional operating \nguidelines may be found in other chapters of Steam. \nSelected areas of interest are listed in Table 1.\nGeneral Boiler Operations\nFundamental principles\nAlthough boiler design and power production have \nbecome sophisticated, basic operating principles still \napply.\nCombustion safety  Before attempting to ignite \nfuel in a furnace, there must be no lingering combustible \nmaterial inside the unit. Purging, or removal of this \nmaterial, assures that the furnace is ready for firing. \nA standard operating rule for multiple burner boilers is \nto purge the unit at no less than 25% of the maximum \ncontinuous rating (MCR) mass air flow for the greater of \nat least five minutes or five volume changes of the boiler \nenclosure.\nOnce combustion is established, the correct air-fuel \nChapter 44\nBoiler Operations\nratio must be maintained. Insufficient air flow may per­\nmit the formation of combustible gas pockets and provide \nan explosion potential. Sufficient air flow to match the \ncombustion requirements of the fuel must be maintained \nand a small amount of excess air should be admitted \nto cover imperfect mixing and to promote air and fuel \ndistribution. For emissions control, many firing systems \nare equipped with one or more levels of air ports installed \nin the upper combustion zones of the furnace. These \noverfire air (OFA) ports are used to stage the combustion \nof the fuel for control of nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions. \nHowever, this controlled introduction of combustion air \ndoes not eliminate the need to provide adequate operating \nexcess air at the furnace outlet for safety.\nThe National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), \namong other organizations, provides and updates \nstandards and protocols for safe combustion.\nCooling requirements  It is important to verify boiler \nwater levels. Combustion should never be established \nuntil adequate cooling water is in the tubes and steam \ndrum for natural and controlled circulation boilers.

The codes are \ncontinuously updated to support quality pressure part \ndesign. (See Appendix 2.)\nCombustion products have also received considerable \nsafety attention. Carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide \n(CO), sulfur oxides and chlorine compounds must be \nconsidered. While CO2 is not poisonous, it reduces oxygen \navailability in the flue gas. The same can occur if CO is \npresent in sufficient quantities. Sulfur oxides can form \nacids and cause harm when breathed into the lungs. \nChlorine compounds can form hydrochloric acids or \ncarcinogens such as dioxin.\nSafe handling of fuel ash must also be considered. \nWhile few ashes contain hazardous materials, heavy \nmetals and arsenic can be present in dangerous levels. \nIn addition, residual combustion may continue in ash \ncollected in hoppers. This is especially true when new \nemissions reduction combustion systems are being \ninstalled.\nFinally, safeguards apply when performing mainte­\nnance and other work on out-of-service boilers. Confined \nspaces may have insufficient oxygen for personnel. Good \nlighting is important for a safe working environment. Ash \naccumulations in out-of-service boiler areas may still be \ntoo hot for maintenance activities.\nInitial Commissioning Operations\nOperator requirements\nGood operation begins before equipment installation \nis complete. It includes training of the operators as well \nas preparation of the equipment.\nEvery operator must be trained to understand and \nfulfill the responsibility assumed for the successful \nperformance of the equipment and for the safety of all \npersonnel involved. To be prepared for all situations \nthat may arise, the operator must have a complete \nknowledge of all components: their designs, purposes, \nlimitations and relationships to other components. \nThis includes thoroughly inspecting the equipment \nand studying the drawings and instructions. The ideal \ntime to become familiar with new equipment is during \nthe pre-operational phase when the equipment is being \ninstalled and commissioned.\nA distributed control system (DCS) integrates the \nindividual process controllers of a steam generation pro­\ncess into a coordinated, interactive system. It enables the \noperator to manage the process as a complete system, with \ncontrol over the interrelationship of various subsystems.\nModern distributed control systems can provide \noperating personnel with advanced simulations of \nequipment behavior. Simulator training is typically in \nreal-time, ensuring not only a working understanding of \nthe various steam generator systems, but also the reaction \ntime and response rate of the equipment. Combined with \nsimulated equipment failures and what-if events, the \noperating personnel can gain valuable experience prior \nto initial operation.\nPreliminary operation should not be entrusted to \ninexperienced personnel who are not familiar with \nthe equipment and the correct operating procedures. \nConsiderable equipment damage and potential safety \nevents can result from improper preparation of equipment \nor its misuse during preliminary checkout.\nTraining takes on special significance during the \ninitial operating period required to prepare the unit for \ncommercial use. Knowledgeable and experienced opera­\ntors are valuable during this period when the controls \nand interlocks are being adjusted, fuel burning equipment \nis being regulated, operating procedures are being \nperfected, and preliminary tests are being conducted to \ndemonstrate the performance and capabilities of the unit.\nPreparations for startup\nA systematic approach is required when a new boiler is \nbeing put into service or when any boiler has undergone \nmajor repairs or alterations. The procedure varies with \nboiler design; however, certain steps are required for all \nboilers. The steps may be classified as inspection, clean­\ning, hydrostatic testing, pre-calibration of instruments \nand controls, auxiliary equipment preparation, chemical \ncleaning, steam line cleaning (blowing), safety valve test­\ning and settings, and initial operations for adjustments \nand testing. Units that use refractory insulation may \nalso require special procedures or operation to condition \nthe refractory.\nInspection  An inspection of the boiler and auxiliary \nequipment serves two purposes: 1) it familiarizes the \noperator with the equipment, and 2) it verifies the condi­\ntion of the equipment. The inspection should begin during \nthe construction phase and continue until all equipment \nis in place and ready to be operated.\nOne item frequently overlooked during inspection is \nthe provision for expansion. The boiler expands as the \ntemperature is increased, as do steam lines, flues and \nducts, sootblower piping, drain piping and all other heated \npieces of equipment. Before heating the boiler (steam \ngenerator), temporary braces, hangers or ties used during \nconstruction must be removed. All expansion joints \nwithin the steam generator and auxiliary equipment, \nand between fixed and expanding parts must be properly \nset and free to move with all shipping and construction \nbraces removed.\nCleaning  Debris and foreign material that ac­\ncumulate during shipment, storage, erection or repairs \nmust be removed. Debris on the water side can restrict \ncirculation or plug drain lines. Debris on the gas side \ncan alter gas or air flows. Combustible material on the \ngas side can ignite and burn at uncontrollable rates and \ncause considerable damage. Glowing embers can be an \nundesirable source of ignition.\nFuel lines, especially oil and gas lines, should be \ncleaned to prevent damage to valves and the plugging of \nburner parts. Steam cleaning is recommended for all oil \nand gas lines, and atomizing steam or air lines.\nHydrostatic test  After the pressure parts are \nassembled, but before the refractory and casing are \ninstalled, a hydrostatic test at 1.5 times the boiler design \npressure is applied to all new boilers and maintained for \n", "char_count": 6442, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_44", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Boiler Operations", "is_complete_section": true}}

Testing is equally \nimportant following pressure part replacements at pres­\nsures specified in local code requirements.\nThe hydrostatic test is normally the first time the \nnew boiler is filled with water; therefore, this is the time \nto begin using high quality water for the prevention \nof internal fouling and corrosion. (See Chapter 43.) \nDemineralized water or condensate treated with 10 ppm \nof ammonia for pH control and an oxygen scavenger to \nalleviate out-of-service corrosion should be used for all \nnondrainable superheaters and reheaters. Clear filtered \nwater is suitable for components that will be drained \nimmediately after the hydrostatic test.\nTemperature plays an important part in hydrostatic \ntesting. The metal temperature and therefore the water \ntemperature must be at or above applicable code require­\nments for hydrostatic testing. For example, the ASME \nCode specifies that the hydrostatic test temperature \nwill not be below 70F (21C) to take advantage of the \ninherent toughness of carbon steel materials as related \nto temperature. The water temperature should be kept \nlow enough so that the pressure parts can be touched and \nclose inspections can be made. It should not be so high that \nwater escaping from small leaks evaporates immediately \nor flashes to steam. Also, the water temperature entering \nthe boiler should not be more than 100F (56C) above the \nmetal temperature to avoid excessive thermal stresses \nin the pressure part.\nFinally, no air should be trapped in the unit during the \nhydrostatic test. As the unit is being filled, each available \nvent should be open until water appears.\nInstrumentation and controls  Every natural \ncirculation boiler has at least two indicating instruments \non the steam drum: a water-steam pressure gauge and \na water level gauge glass. If a superheater is included, \nsome type of steam temperature indicator is also used. \nOnce-through boilers have steam pressure gauges, flow \nmeters and temperature indicators. These indicators are \nimportant because the pressure, temperature levels and \nflows indicated by them must be controlled within design \nlimits. Therefore, the indicators must be correct. Opera­\ntion should not be attempted until these instruments are \ncalibrated, and the calibrations should include corrections \nfor actual operating conditions. Water-leg correction for \nthe pressure gauge is one example. (See Chapter 41.)\nMost modern boilers are controlled automatically \nonce they are fully commissioned. However, before these \nboilers can be started up, the controls must be operated on \nmanual until the automatic controls have been adjusted \nfor site-specific conditions. Automatic control operations \nshould not be attempted until the automatic functions \nhave been calibrated and proven reliable over the load \nrange.\nWith modern control systems it is essential that the \nmultiple interfacing control loops communicate correctly \nwith each other and at appropriate speeds, so that the \nsteam generator, turbine and electrical generator act as \na unit with increasing and decreasing load changes. If \nthese loops are not properly interfaced then the operator \nwill see erratic changes when the controls are placed into \nautomatic control.\nAuxiliary equipment  The auxiliary equipment must \nalso be prepared for operation. This equipment includes \nair compressors to supply instrument and service air; \nelectrical supply for motors and the control system \nwhere applicable; fans to supply air for combustion and \nto transport fuel; feedwater pumps to supply water; fuel \nequipment to supply, prepare and burn the fuel; and air \nheaters to heat the air for combustion. This equipment \nalso includes an economizer to heat the water and cool \nthe flue gas, ash removal equipment, a drain system to \ndrain the boiler when required, a sootblowing system to \nadequately clean the heat transfer surfaces, and post-\ncombustion environmental control equipment.\nPost-combustion emissions control equipment can be \nquite complicated and extensive. It may include ammonia \nor urea injection directly into the furnace for NOx control \nor into a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system in \nthe gas stream between the economizer and air heater. \nOperators may need to prepare wet or dry sulfur dioxide \n(SO2) scrubbers before firing the steam generator to meet \nemissions limits even during the startup phase of the unit. \nLikewise, precipitators and fabric filters must be readied \nfor service to maintain required particulate emissions \nduring startup. It is important that manufacturer’s \nprocedures be followed when starting this equipment at \nlow gas flows and temperatures to avoid corrosion and \noperating problems from the chemical reactions that take \nplace at these operating conditions. The environmental \nequipment will affect gas flow pressure drops through \nthe system and the forced draft and induced draft fans \nmust be appropriately set to control combustion air flow \nand furnace pressure when raising steam pressure on \nthe boiler. Minimum air flow is required when burners \nare in service and all the environmental equipment must \nbe operating properly once main fuel is fired. As the \nfiring rate is increased, the operator must maintain a \nproper flow of chemical compounds to each environmental \ncomponent to maintain emissions below the required \nlimits.\nChemical cleaning  Water-side cleanliness is \nimportant for all boilers because water-side impurities \ncan lead to boiler tube failures. Boiler water impurities \ncan also lead to carryover of solids in the steam, resulting \nin superheater tube failure or turbine blade damage.\nThe flushing of all loose debris from the feedwater \nsystem and boiler, and the use of high quality water for the \nhydrostatic test, must be supplemented by proper water-\nside cleaning before startup. To remove accumulations of \noil, grease and other contaminants, the natural circula­\ntion boiler is given a caustic and phosphate boilout after \nthe feedwater system has been given a phosphate flush. \nThe once-through boiler and its associated pre-boiler \nequipment are given a similar flushing. This boiling out \nand/or flushing should be accomplished before operation.\nAfter boiling out and flushing are completed, products \nof corrosion still remain in the feedwater system and \nboiler in the form of mill scale and iron oxide. It is \nrecommended that acid cleaning for the removal of this \nmill scale and iron oxide be delayed until operations at \nfairly high capacities have carried loose scale and oxides \nfrom the feedwater system to the boiler. This results in \na cleaner boiler for subsequent operations. Chemical \ncleaning of internal heating surfaces is described in \nChapter 43.\nSteam line blowing  Fine mesh strainers are cus­\n", "char_count": 6888, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_44", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Boiler Operations", "is_complete_section": true}}
{"chunk_id": "unit_001_page_004", "page_number": 4, "text": "44-4\nSteam 42 / Boiler Operations\nThe Babcock & Wilcox Company\ntomarily installed in turbine inlet steam lines to protect \nturbine blades or valves against damage from scale or \nother solid material that may be carried by the initial flow \nof steam. In addition, many operators use high velocity \nsteam to clean the superheater and steam lines of any \nloose scale or foreign material before coupling the steam \nline to the turbine. The actual procedure used depends on \nthe design of the unit. Temporary piping for flow bypass \nto the atmosphere is required with all procedures. This \npiping and any noise reduction silencers must be securely \nanchored to resist the high nozzle reaction created during \nthe high velocity blowing period.\nSeveral methods are used for blowing steam lines, \nincluding high pressure air and steam blowing. The rec­\nommended method is steam blowing because experience \nhas shown that temperature shock and high velocities are \nthe most effective means of removing loose scale and other \ndebris. Sufficient thermal shock is obtained with a series \nof blows where the steam temperature changes during \neach blow. Lower pressure, high velocity steam blowing \ntechniques are also available, including those that \nutilize high velocity treated water injection to promote \nthermal shocking of the mill scale and debris. Designed \nand managed correctly, these techniques provide safe \nremoval of scale and other solid particles detrimental to \nturbine components.\nOn forced circulation units, steam from the flash tank \nor vertical steam separator is used to feed the superheater \nelements, headers and steam lines. On drum-type units, \nsteam pressure is raised to specific limits and then \nrapidly released to produce high velocities through the \nsuperheater, headers and piping. Temporary valving is \nrequired to control the flow rates during the blowing \nperiod.\nBoiler pressure and temperature can be maintained \nduring the blowing period by continuous firing. If firing \nis discontinued during the blowing period, any change \nin boiler pressure changes the saturation temperature \nthroughout the system. To avoid excessive thermal shock, \nchanges in boiler pressure should be limited to those \ncorresponding to 75F (42C) in saturation temperature \nduring the relatively short blowing periods.\nSafety valves  Safety valves are essential to the safe \noperation of any pressure vessel, allowing adequate relief \nof excess pressure during abnormal operating conditions. \n(See Chapter 25.) The set point of each safety valve is \nnormally checked and adjusted, if necessary, immediately \nafter reaching full operating pressure for the first time \nwith steam. Safety valve seats are susceptible to damage \nfrom wet steam or grit. This is an essential reason for \ncleaning the boiler and blowing out the superheater and \nsteam line before testing safety valves.\nSafety valves on drum-type boilers are normally tested \nboth for set point pressure and for the closing pressures. \nThis generally requires that the boiler pressure be raised \nuntil the valves open and then reduced until the valves close. \nThe testing of safety valves always requires caution. \nSafety valve exhaust piping and vent piping should not \nexert any excessive forces on the safety valve. \nWhen preparing for a hydrostatic test or testing safety \nvalves to adjust activation pressures, the valve supplier’s \ninstallation instructions should be followed carefully, \nespecially as they relate to the use of hydro plugs and \ngags during these procedures. Hydro plugs are devices \nplaced in the bore of the valve inside the seating surface \nto prevent the valve from opening during a hydrostatic \ntest and to protect the valve seat should it lift. Gags are \nclamp-like devices installed to restrict the movement of \nthe valve shaft to prevent or limit opening. Gags should \nalways be installed for protection in case the boiler \npressure rises while making valve adjustments.\nAs an alternate, safety valves can be tested and set \nwith the boiler pressure below the safety valve design \npressure by supplementing the boiler pressure with a \nhydraulic lift, attached to the valve stem, in accordance \nwith the manufacturer’s instructions. This hydraulic \nassist method reduces the risk of damage to the valve \nseat from extended steam flow in a conventional test.\nTesting, inspection and verification of each safety \nvalve’s functionality should be performed by personnel \ncertified to work on this equipment.\nStartup  Operating procedures vary with boiler \ndesign. There are, however, certain objectives that should \nbe included in the operating procedures of every boiler. \nThese objectives include: \n1.\t protection of pressure parts against corrosion, \noverheating and thermal stresses, \n2.\t prevention of furnace explosions, \n3.\t production of steam at the desired temperature, \npressure and purity, and \n4.\t compliance with environmental regulations.\nEach piece of equipment in a power plant is typically \nsupplied with manufacturer’s assembly and operating \ninstructions. These should be read and understood by all \nappropriate plant personnel before placing equipment into \nuse. Attention should be paid to all warning and hazard \nsigns associated with each piece of equipment.\nFilling  When filling the boiler for startup, certain \nprecautions should be taken to protect the pressure \nparts. First, high quality water should be used to \nminimize water-side corrosion and deposits. Second, the \ntemperature of the water should be regulated to match \nthe temperature of the boiler metal to prevent thermal \nstresses. High temperature differentials can cause \nthermal stresses in the pressure parts and, if severe, \nwill adversely affect the life of the pressure parts. High \ntemperature differentials can also distort the pressure \nparts enough to break studs, lugs and other attachments. \nDifferential temperatures up to 100F (56C) are generally \nconsidered acceptable.\nA third precaution taken during the filling operation \nis the use of vents to displace all air with water. This \nreduces oxygen corrosion and assures that all boiler tubes \nare filled with water.\nA fourth precaution on drum-type boilers is to \nestablish the correct water level before firing begins. The \nwater level rises with temperature. Therefore, only 1 in. \n(25 mm) of water is typically required in the gauge glass, \nexcept with certain special designs that may require a \nhigher starting level to fill all circulating tubes exposed \nto the hot flue gases.\nOn high pressure, large steam drum boilers, a high \nwater level gauge glass may be installed for use during the \npressure raising period to stabilize metal temperatures \nthroughout the drum, from top to bottom and from \n", "char_count": 6746, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_44", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Boiler Operations", "is_complete_section": true}}

This alleviates \ndifferential expansion of the top and bottom of the drum, \nreferred to as drum humping, and alleviates differential \nstresses to the rolled or welded connections. Drum water \nlevel should be lowered to operating level, and the high \nlevel gauge isolated out of service until required for the \nnext shutdown or startup before steam flow out of the \nunit is established. \nCirculation  Overheating of boiler tubes is prevented \nby the sufficient flow of fluid through the tubes. Flow is \nproduced in a natural circulation boiler by the force of \ngravity acting on fluids of different densities. Flow starts \nwhen the density of the water in the heated tubes is less \nthan that in the downcomers. The mass flow in each tube \nincreases as the heat input to each tube is increased. (See \nChapter 5.) With increasing heat input to each tube in the \nboiler circuits (all the tubes coming from and returning \nto the steam drum), steam bubbles (nucleate boiling) \nare produced in the tubes and the quantity of steam in \neach tube is increased at a rate proportional to the heat \ninput. Thus, the furnace of a natural circulation steam \ngenerator is designed to circulate fluid through the tubes, \nheaders and drums at increasing rates up to and including \nmaximum nameplate steam flow, or MCR.\nCirculation rates required for cooling of the boiler \ncircuits are dependent on constant operating pressure, per \ndesign, and maintaining design water level in the steam \ndrum. Other factors important for proper cooling include \nproper water treatment maintenance, design distribution \nof heat input to the furnace, and unit operation in ac­\ncordance with the manufacturer’s operating instructions. \nSome drum-type boilers are designed for forced or assisted \ncirculation and depend on the use of circulating pumps \nin the boiler circuitry to assist this flow. Though rare, \na natural circulating unit can be designed to operate at \nvarying steam pressure.\nA once-through boiler depends on the boiler feedwater \npump to produce the necessary flow. Whenever a \nonce-through boiler is being fired, a minimum flow \nmust be maintained through the furnace circuits. On a \nconstant furnace pressure once-through unit, a bypass \nsystem is used. (See Chapter 19.) The fluid can bypass \nthe superheater and turbine until saturated steam is \navailable for admission to the superheater and until \nthe turbine is using sufficient steam to maintain the \nminimum furnace circuit flow. For variable furnace \npressure once-through units, The Babcock & Wilcox \nCompany (B&W) uses vertical steam-water separators \nto return the water to the furnace through a circulating \npump and allow the steam to follow a path through the \nsuperheaters for operating the main turbine and warming \nof external equipment during the minimum flow period. \n(See Chapter 19.)\nPurging  Attention must be given to the prevention \nof furnace explosions, especially on units burning fuel in \nsuspension. Most furnace explosions occur during startup \nand low load periods. Whenever the possibility exists for \nthe accumulation of combustible gases or combustible \ndust in any part of the unit, no attempt should be made \nto light the burners until the unit has been thoroughly \npurged. The NFPA Boiler and Combustion Systems \nCode (NFPA 85) provides the consensus procedures for \npurging of various boiler and combustion systems. For \nmulti-burner boilers, the purge rate from the forced draft \nfan through the stack is at least 25% of the full load mass \nair flow which must be maintained for the greater of five \nminutes or five volume changes of the boiler enclosure. A \nmaximum of 40% of the full load mass air flow is specified \nfor coal-fired units only, while no upper limit is set for \noil- or gas-fired units.\nProtection of economizer  Very little water, if any, is \nadded to the drum-type boiler during the pressure raising \nperiod; consequently, there is no feedwater flow through \nthe economizer. Although economizers are located in \nrelatively low temperature zones, they can generate steam \nduring the pressure raising period. This steam remains \ntrapped until feedwater is fed through the economizer. \nThis trapped steam not only makes the control of steam \ndrum water level difficult, it can cause water hammer. \nThis difficulty is overcome if feedwater is supplied \ncontinuously by venting the economizer of steam or by \nrecirculating boiler water through the economizer. If a \nrecirculating line is available, the valve in this line must \nremain open until feedwater is being fed continuously \nthrough the economizer to the boiler. This valve should \nthen be closed once continuous flow is established and \nremain closed during normal boiler operation.\nProtection of primary, secondary and reheat su­\nperheater  During normal operation, every superheater \ntube must have sufficient steam flow to prevent overheat­\ning. During startup and when steam flow has not been \nevenly established through every tube, the combustion gas \ntemperature entering the superheater must be controlled \nto limit superheater metal temperatures to 900F (482C) \nfor carbon steel tubes and 950 to 1000F (510 to 538C) for \nvarious alloy tubes. While firing rate is used primarily \nto control gas temperatures, other means are also useful, \ne.g., excess air, gas recirculation and burner selection.\nGas temperature entering the superheater dur­\ning startup is typically measured with retractable \nthermoprobes that are removed as soon as steam flow is \nestablished in every superheater tube. (See Chapter 41.) \nOther permanent gas temperature monitoring devices \nare available, but precautions must be taken so that their \ninstalled locations, usage and maintenance are adequate \nfor the task of measuring gas temperatures entering the \nsuperheater. These devices should be used on all startups \nand restarts to be sure that all steam circuits have been \nboiled free of condensate before increasing heat input.\nThe two prerequisites for steam flow through every \nsuperheater tube are: 1) removal of all water from each \ntube, and 2) a total steam flow equal to or greater than \napproximately 10% of rated steam flow. Water is removed \nfrom drainable superheaters by simply opening the header \ndrains and vents. Nondrainable superheaters are not \nas simple because trapped water must be boiled away. \nThere will be no steam flow through a superheater tube \npartially filled with water, and those portions of the tube \nnot in contact with water can be subjected to excessive \ntemperatures unless the gas temperature is limited.\nThermocouples attached to the outlet legs of nondrain­\nable superheater tubes, where they pass into the unheated \nvestibule, will read at saturation temperature at the \nexisting pressure until a flow of steam is established \nthrough the tube. The temperature of these outlet legs will \nrise sharply above saturation temperature immediately \n", "char_count": 7022, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_44", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Boiler Operations", "is_complete_section": true}}

Superheater tubes adjacent to \nside walls and division walls are normally the last to \nboil clear. These should, therefore, have thermocouples.\nIt is extremely important that all thermocouples \nread the correct tube metal temperature. These tube \ntemperatures should be checked for accuracy during \nmaintenance procedures.\nProtection of drums and headers  In most instal­\nlations, the time required to place a boiler in service \nis limited to the time necessary for raising pressure \nand protecting the superheater and the reheater from \noverheating. In some cases, however, the time for both \nstarting up and shutting down may be determined by the \ntime required to limit the thermal stresses in the drums \nand headers. Protection of drums and headers can pose \nsignificant challenges for operators faced with the need \nto cycle the steam generator on/off for load demand. (See \nOn/off cycling.)\nVarious rules, based on thermal stress analysis and \nsupported by operating experience, have been formulated \nand accepted as general practice. The rules fall into three \ncategories: one for drums and headers with rolled tube \njoints, a second set for drums with rolled tube joints and \nheaders with welded tube joints, and a third set for drums \nand headers both with welded tube joints.\nOn drums and headers with rolled tube joints, the \nrelatively thin tubes contract and expand at a much faster \nrate than the thicker drum or header walls; therefore, \ntube seat leaks are likely to occur if heating and cooling \nrates are not controlled. To minimize this stress, heating \nand cooling rates have been established at 100F (56C) \nchange in saturation temperature per hour.\nHeaders with welded tube connections present less of \na problem with tube seat leaks or with header distortion \nbecause the tubes are welded to the headers and the \nheaders are normally filled with fluid at a constant \ntemperature. The concern is mainly with temperature \ndifferentials through the header wall and the resulting \nincipient cracking if excessive thermal stresses occur.\nSteam drums with welded tube connections are not \nsubject to tube seat leaks but, because they contain \nwater in the bottom and steam in the top, the heating \nand cooling rates vary between the top and the bottom. \nThis results in temperature differences between the top \nand the bottom of the drum. Stress analyses show that \nthe principal criterion for reliable rates of heating and \ncooling should be based on the relationship between \nthe temperature differential through the drum wall \nand the temperature differential between the top and \nbottom of the drum, both of which are measured in the \nsame circumferential plane. Allowable temperature \ndifferentials are based on material strength, drum \ndiameter, wall thickness and pressure. Therefore, each \nsteam drum has its own characteristics.\nTo determine the temperature differentials during \nstartup and shutdown periods, it is necessary to continu­\nously monitor the outside and inside surface temperatures \nof the drum shell. Temperatures of the outside of the drum \nshell are best determined by thermocouples. At least six \noutside thermocouples are required: one on the top and \nbottom of each end (all outside the internal baffle and \nscrubber area), and two in the center, one placed at the top \nand one on the bottom. Temperatures of the inside of the \ndrum shell are best determined by placing thermocouples \non one of the riser tubes entering the bottom of the drum, \none on each end, and one in the center.\nThere are two periods when the steam in the top of \nthe drum is hotter than the water occupying the lower \nhalf. One period is soon after firing begins on boilers with \nlarge nondrainable superheaters. Steam forms first in \nthe superheater and flows back to the steam drum where \nit heats the top of the drum. A second period is during \ncooling when cold air is blown through the boiler by the \nforced draft fans. The boiler water cools, but the steam \nin the top of the steam drum remains at essentially the \nsame temperature.\nThe temperatures of the top and bottom can be brought \nclose together by flooding the steam drum with water. \nFiring must be stopped and water must not be allowed \nto enter into the superheater. A high level gauge glass is \nneeded for this operation. Thermocouples attached to the \nsuperheater supply tubes can be used to indicate when \nthe drum is flooded because there is a sharp change \nin temperature when water enters these supply tubes. \nAllowable temperature differentials for cooling are \nstringent, considerably more so than for heating. Fast \ncooling should, therefore, be supervised with the use of \nthermocouples and a high level gauge glass.\nCooling is particularly important when the boiler is \nto be drained for short outages. The steam drum must be \ncooled to permit filling with the available water without \nexceeding the allowable temperature rate of change. (See \nFig. 1.) A wider latitude is permitted if the water used for \nfilling is hotter than the steam drum.\nBefore removing the unit from service, more uniform \ncooling can be achieved by reducing pressure to approxi­\nmately two-thirds of the normal operating pressure. This \nreduces the temperature of both the water and steam in \nthe steam drum.\nA boiler cools faster if a high water level is maintained \nin the drum while continuing to provide air flow to the \nunit. Water shrinkage can simultaneously be replaced \nby cooler feedwater as long as it is within 100F (56C) of \nthe drum metal temperature.\nOperating techniques for maximum efficiency\nFuel is a major cost in boiler operation.

Although a boiler’s efficiency is \nprimarily a result of its design, the operator can maintain \nor significantly improve efficiency by controlling losses \nto the stack and losses to the ash pit.\nStack losses  The total heat that exits the last heat \ntrap is controlled by the quantity and the temperature \nof the flue gas. The quantity of gas is dependent on the \nfuel being burned, but is also influenced by the amount \nof excess air supplied to the burners. While sufficient air \nmust be provided to complete the combustion process, \nexcessive quantities of air simply carry extra heat out \nof the stack and result in a subsequent efficiency loss.\nThe temperature of the flue gas is affected by the clean­\nliness of the steam generator’s heat transfer surfaces. \nThis in turn is dependent on sootblower performance \nand air heater operation. Optimal cleanliness of the heat \ntransfer surfaces is achievable with advanced diagnostic \nand control systems that measure the heat transfer \neffectiveness of the furnace and superheater banks, \nevaluate against the design duty, and clean only on an \nas-needed basis. While high gas temperatures exiting the \nlast heat trap waste energy, excessively low temperatures \nmay also be unacceptable. Corrosion can occur at the \nacid dew point of the gas where corrosive constituents in \nthe flue gas condense on the cooler metal surfaces. Ash \nplugging of heat transfer surfaces in the air heater can \nbe aggravated by the presence of condensate. Protection \nand performance of environmental components, such as \nan SCR, can also impose constraints on boiler exit gas \ntemperature.\nPressures and temperatures  Most boilers supply \nsteam to turbines or processes that require heat. These \nprocesses rely on specific pressures and temperatures. \nDeviations from the set points may result in lower overall \nefficiency of the power cycle, loss of production, or damage \nto the equipment or process.\nIn units that produce saturated steam, boiler tem­\nperature is directly related to the operating pressure. For \nmany industrial applications, the process requirements \ndictate the steam temperature and consequently the \noperating pressure.\nFor electric power producing steam systems, steam \ntemperature has a significant impact on turbine \nefficiency. Modern controls can typically maintain this \ntemperature within 10F (6C) of the desired setting. For \na supercritical pressure unit, each 50F (28C) reduction \nin steam temperature reduces cycle efficiency by ap­\nproximately 1%.\nVariable pressure operation  Historically, utility \nsteam generators in the United States (U.S.) have been \noperated at a constant steam outlet pressure and the \nturbine load has been controlled by varying the throttle \nvalves at the turbine inlet. This causes an efficiency loss \nat lower loads due to the temperature drop across the \nthrottle valves.\nIn variable pressure operation, boiler pressure is var­\nied to meet turbine requirements. This can significantly \nimprove cycle efficiency when operating at low loads (15 \nto 40% of MCR). However, boiler response to turbine \nrequirements is slower in this mode. When fast response \nis needed, pressure increments are used. At a given pres­\nsure, the throttle valves control the steam to the turbine \nand provide quick response. As turbine requirements \nincrease and the valves approach full open position, the \nboiler pressure is increased to the next increment and the \nturbine valves are throttled back to provide some amount \nof pressure control. This arrangement provides high \nefficiency while retaining quick response. See Chapter \n42 for steam pressure control methods.\nEmissions requirements  Many steam generators \ncurrently in operation were not originally designed for \ntoday’s environmental regulations. Hardware changes \nmade to accomplish emissions reduction are typically ac­\ncompanied by new operating philosophies and guidelines \nfor efficiency and equipment protection. For example, to \nachieve the lowest possible NOx emission levels, the com­\nbustion system must be altered and flue gas temperature \nto the SCR regulated to a precise temperature window to \nmaintain SCR efficiency and minimize ammonia usage \nand slip. To reduce the amount of NOx produced in the \nfurnace by the fuel burning process, design changes to \nthe combustion systems have progressed from circular \nhigh spin, high velocity burners, to low NOx burners with \nexcess air, to substoichiometric burner air flow and staged \ncombustion in the furnace.\nStaging of combustion air is frequently used in firing \nsystem upgrades to reduce NOx emissions. Sufficient \ncare must be taken to ensure that lower furnace cor­\nrosion associated with the reducing atmosphere is not \nexcessive, especially with high sulfur fuels. Depending \non system design, there may be tradeoffs between lower \nNOx generation and increases in the carbon content in \nthe ash and CO in the flue gas. To maintain ash quality \nsuitable for disposal or sale, operational balance must \nbe achieved within the combustion process. Furnace \ncombustion is also usually controlled to achieve a specific \nCO emissions rate.\nCombustion optimization  A modern DCS offers \na significant amount of information to assist operating \npersonnel in optimizing steam generator performance. \nClosed loop neural network systems and other advanced \nintelligent control systems have made strides in main­\ntaining optimum combustion performance throughout \nthe operating range. Variants of these systems use \ncomplex databases and algorithms to guide the controlling \nparameters during steady-state and transient operation. \nExtensive parametric testing of the unit is conducted to \ndefine the characteristics and boundaries of the variables. \nAs long as no subsequent mechanical modifications are \nadded and proper equipment maintenance is available, \nthese advanced control systems are capable of consistently \nreturning the steam generator to its optimum operating \ncondition. A significant attribute of these systems is the \nability to target specific results during optimization and \nchange the targeted parameter as needed. As a result, \nNOx can be minimized during selected periods and heat \nrate can be minimized the rest of the operating year.\nKey operation functions\nBurner adjustments  The fuel and combustion air \ncombine and release heat at the burners. To maintain \neven heat distribution across the width of the furnace, \nair and fuel flows must be evenly supplied to all burners. \nWhile individual burner adjustments affect a particular \nburner, they can also impact adjacent burners.

{"chunk_id": "unit_001_page_008", "page_number": 8, "text": "44-8\nSteam 42 / Boiler Operations\nThe Babcock & Wilcox Company\nboilers have multiple burners in parallel flow paths on \nthe front and/or rear furnace walls. Burners must be \nsimilar in design and must be adjusted in the same way \nto optimize air flow distribution. For a detailed discussion \nof burner features see Chapters 11 and 14.\nAdjustments can typically vary the turbulence and \nflow rates in burners. Increased turbulence increases the \nair-fuel mixing. It also increases the combustion intensity, \nprovides faster heat release, reduces unburned carbon \n(UBC) in the ash, permits operation with less excess \nair, and increases boiler efficiency. However, increased \nslagging, increased NOx emissions and higher fan power \nconsumption can also result.\nFuel flow adjustments to individual burners are also \npossible, either through diverter mechanisms in the fuel \npreparation system or through flow balancing devices in \nthe coal transport piping. While possible, the dynamic \nbalancing of fuel flow is difficult. As with combustion \nair adjustments, potential impacts to adjacent burners \nwill require reliable feedback on relative flow rates to be \neffective as a dynamic operational tool. Advances in flame \ncharacterization systems and sensors for post-combustion \nconstituents can provide more precise feedback for online \nfuel balancing. In situ coal and combustion air flow \nmeasurement devices are also being used for real-time \nair and fuel flow measurement. One tool available to \noperators is the Flame Doctor® flame monitoring system. \nThe system can be attached to any wall-fired unit to \nmonitor the flame quality of each individual burner in \ncomparison to all of the burners. With this information \nthe operator can adjust individual burner air and fuel \nflows to balance the entire system, improve combustion \nefficiency, lower excess air, and lower NOx emissions \nfrom the furnace.\nOverfire (staged) air port adjustments  Burner \nsystems intended for NOx reduction are typically staged \nso that the primary combustion elevation is usually \noperated with less than the theoretical air required \nfor complete combustion. The remaining air needed to \ncomplete the burning process is introduced separately, \nabove the highest burner zone, through OFA ports. The \nstaging air flow is typically varied as a function of load, \nbased on parametric testing performed during commis­\nsioning. This staging of air to complete combustion of \nthe volatilized fixed carbon and CO gas above the burner \nzone allows for significant reduction of NOx formation \nin the reducing atmosphere of the burner zone. While \nnormally satisfactory for ensuring complete combustion \nand emissions compliance, any changes to fuel type, fuel \npreparation quality, or the fuel and air transport systems \nwill require close monitoring of OFA system performance. \nMore advanced dynamic control schemes are available, \ndependent on measurement feedback of the combustion \nprocess in the upper furnace zones, to control the proper \nair flow to each staging zone. \nExcess air  The total combustion air flow to a bal­\nanced draft boiler is generally controlled by adjusting the \nquantity of air from the forced draft fan and controlling \nthe furnace draft with the induced draft fan in relation \nto the fuel flow. Excess air is the additional combustion \nair above the amount required to theoretically burn \n(stoichiometric air) a given amount of fuel. Excess air \ncompensates for mixing inadequacies in the furnace. \nThe benefits of increasing excess air include increased \ncombustion intensity, reduced carbon loss and/or CO for­\nmation, and reduced slagging conditions. Disadvantages \ninclude increased fan power consumption, increased heat \nloss up the stack, increased tube erosion, and possibly \nincreased NOx formation.\nFor most coal ashes, particularly those from eastern \nU.S. bituminous coals, the solid to liquid phase changes \noccur at lower temperatures if free oxygen is not present \n(reducing conditions) around the ash particles. As a \nresult, more slagging occurs in a boiler operating with \ninsufficient excess air where localized reducing conditions \ncan occur.\nLocalized tube metal wastage may also occur in \nfurnace walls under low excess air conditions but the \nimpact is less clearly defined. The absence of free oxygen \n(a reducing atmosphere) and the presence of sulfur \n(from the fuel) are known causes of tube metal wastage. \nThe sulfur combines with hydrogen from the fuel to \nform hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The H2S reacts with the \niron in the tube metal and forms iron sulfide, which is \nsubsequently swept away with the flue gas. High chlorine \nlevels can also promote tube wastage. Although most coals \nand conventional fuels burned in the U.S. contain very \nlittle chlorine, it is a severe problem in refuse-derived \nfuels. (See Chapter 29.)\nFuel conditions  Fuel conditions can significantly \nimpact combustion performance of all types of boilers. \nFuel conditions include temperature, pressure and \nparticle size. Cooler temperatures, lower pressure and \nlarger particle size contribute to less complete combustion \nand increased unburned carbon in the ash. Conversely, \nif the fuel is hotter and finer, combustion is improved. \nHowever, NOx emissions and slagging can also increase \nwith these conditions. Current combustion technologies \nemploy multi-zone low NOx burners to control the \npace of combustion and are more demanding on mean \nparticle size and distribution for control of NOx and UBC \nproduction.\nEffects of fuel preparation equipment on boiler \nperformance  Fuel preparation equipment readies the \nfuel for combustion and can have a significant impact \non emissions. The preparation equipment includes the \ncrushers, pulverizers and drying systems on coal-fired \nunits; fuel oil heaters and pumps on oil-fired units; refuse \nhandling, mixing or drying equipment on refuse-fired \nboilers; or fuel handling, blending, sizing and delivery \nequipment on stoker-fired units. If this equipment is \nnot properly maintained and operated, the fuel may not \nbe completely burned, leaving UBC in the ash or CO in \nthe flue gas.\nThe operator must monitor the fuel preparation \nequipment. Knowledge of the equipment, its maintenance \nrecord and operating characteristics is essential. \nBurning different fuels  The fuel feed system and the \ngrate design for stoker-fired units are based on specific \nfuel type and sizing of the coal, wood, bark, refuse or \nother type of solid fuel. If proper sizing is not maintained \nper the specified design, then operating difficulties and \ninefficiencies are likely to occur.\nThe fuel preparation, sizing, delivery and combustion \nequipment on pulverized coal units are designed to \nhandle a specific type of coal or similar coals if more \n", "char_count": 6800, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_44", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Boiler Operations", "is_complete_section": true}}

The furnace volume and surface are \ndesigned to cool the flue gas below the initial deformation \ntemperature of the ash for the specified design coal. \nIf the coal characteristics vary significantly from the \ndesign specifications, then the furnace will be under \nor over absorbing. This will lead to greater slagging in \nunder-absorbing conditions and less steam generation \nin the furnace. Over-absorbing conditions result in less \nheat available in the convection pass for superheating. \nThis will require operator or design changes to achieve \ndesired final steam conditions.\nPulverized coal-fired units in the 1950s and 1960s \nwere designed so that the pulverizers would deliver fuel \nto the burners based on 70% of the fuel passing through \na 200 mesh screen. This was acceptable based on closely \nspaced burners with high recirculation rates within the \nburner to burn the coal quickly in a very hot furnace \nenvelope. When NOx limitations forced the designer to \nspace out the burners and slow the mixing of the fuel, \nboth in the burner and through combustion staging in the \nfurnace, it became very important to look at coal sizing \nbased on the amount of large particles. More emphasis \nhas thus been placed on the pulverizer to maintain a \nfineness of 99% or greater passing through a 50 mesh \nscreen to reduce UBC leaving the furnace. Therefore, it \nis essential that the operator maintain the ability of the \ncoal handling equipment to achieve this higher standard.\nIn the late 1960s operators in the northeast U.S. \nbegan to switch from firing pulverized coal to firing \n#6 oil for several reasons. Oil was easier to transport, \nreadily available, less expensive than coal per Btu, more \nefficient to burn, and was basically free of ash so that \nparticulate cleanup equipment was much less expensive. \nNOx emissions could be controlled through burner design \nor combustion staging. The operator had to maintain \nburner equipment, oil atomizer condition and cleanliness, \nfuel transport and heating systems, and atomizing steam \nif a mechanical atomizer was not used. This equipment \nwas significantly easier to operate and required much \nless manpower than a coal-fired unit. However, with \nthe shortage and increasing cost of fuel oil, it is not cost \neffective for a utility to fire oil in large-scale applications. \nIf a unit was originally designed to fire oil, it may be \ncost effective to switch to natural gas based on required \nemissions compliance.\nThe majority of natural gas- or waste gas-fired boilers \nin the U.S. are in industrial power plants and heating \nstations. Most of the package boilers used for heating, \ncooling and process steam are now fired by natural gas. It \nis extremely important that operators are knowledgeable \non all safety conditions and procedures for operating \nthese units.\nSome operators have elected to switch their coal-fired \nboilers to natural gas firing because of favorable fuel \nprices or the cost of adding emissions control equipment. \nOn utility and larger industrial units with superheaters, \nthis may require physical changes to heat traps as well \nas changes to the burner and fuel handling equipment.\nFeedwater and boiler water conditioning require­\nments  The main function of a boiler is to transfer heat \nfrom combustion gases through tube walls to heat water \nand produce steam. Clean metal tubes are good conduc­\ntors, but impurities in the water can collect on the inside \nsurface of the tubes. These deposits reduce heat transfer, \nelevate tube temperatures, and can lead to tube failures. \nWater conditioning is essential to minimize deposits and \nmaintain unit availability. (See Chapter 43.)\nSootblower operations  As discussed in Chapter \n24, a sootblower is an automated device that uses steam, \ncompressed air, or high pressure water to remove ash \ndeposits from tube surfaces. Sootblowing improves heat \ntransfer by reducing fouling and plugging. However, \nexcessive sootblowing can result in increased operating \ncost, tube erosion and increased sootblower maintenance. \nConversely, infrequent sootblower operation can reduce \nboiler efficiency and capacity. Optimum sootblowing \ndepends on load conditions, combustion quality and \nfuel. Cleanliness of the heat transfer surfaces has \ntraditionally been left to the operator’s discretion and \nexperience. With the increased dependency in the U.S. on \nsubbituminous coals and the cost attractiveness of spot \nmarket fuels, advanced sootblowing control systems are \nbeing deployed to assist operators in providing optimal \nsootblowing performance. Unlike manual guidelines, \nthese intelligent sootblowing systems do not rely on fuel \ncharacteristics to influence cleaning patterns. Rather, \nthey rely primarily on monitoring boiler heat transfer \nperformance to determine the frequency of sootblower \noperation. Since cleaning is performed based solely on an \nas-needed basis, the intelligent sootblowing systems are \nideally suited for operations dealing with changing fuel \nblends. Furnace-based sootblowing equipment is increas­\ningly being controlled with advanced control schemes that \nmonitor the heat flux in select zones, supervise blower \noperation for effectiveness, and minimize thermal shock \nto the furnace wall tubes.\nB&W developed two systems that can be applied to \nboth new and existing units for more effective sootblow­\ning. The PowerClean® intelligent sootblowing system \nand Heat Transfer Manager® heat flux system monitor \nreal-time performance of the entire steam generator and \ncompare operating data to the as-designed performance. \nTogether, the systems select the areas to clean by priority \nbased on each heat trap’s effective heat transfer efficiency \nin comparison to design efficiency. This reduces the \nsootblower use, enhances overall efficiency, and effectively \nmaintains an efficient heat rate for the plant. \nPersonnel safety  Operating instructions usually \ndeal primarily with the protection of equipment. Rules \nand devices for personnel protection are also essential, \nregardless of the type of boiler design or fuel. Safety \ntraining programs and written safety procedures are \nintegral to the safe operation of all plant equipment. \nWhile not exhaustive, the items listed here are based on \nactual operating experience and point out some typical \npersonnel safety precautions.\n1.\t When viewing flames or furnace conditions, always \nwear tinted goggles or a tinted shield to protect the \neyes from harmful light intensity and flying ash or \nslag particles.\n2.\t Do not stand directly in front of open ports or doors, \nespecially when they are being opened. Furnace \npulsations caused by firing conditions, sootblower \noperation, or tube failure can blow hot furnace gases \nout of open doors, even on balanced draft units. \nAspirating air is used on inspection doors and ports \n", "char_count": 6931, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_44", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Boiler Operations", "is_complete_section": true}}

Once the unit has \nreached full capacity, and solid fuel boilers have the oppor­\ntunity for ash and slag to build up to a commercially clean \ncondition, performance tests can be run. Performance \ntesting serves two important functions: 1) determines \nwhether the manufacturer has met contractual obliga­\ntions regarding the agreed upon performance guarantees, \nand 2) establishes a baseline performance for the unit in \nwhich to compare future operations to determine possible \nperformance deficiencies.\nDuring these tests, accurate data should be taken to \nserve as reference points for future operation. Sampling \npoints that give representative indications of gas tempera­\ntures, excess air and combustibles in the ash should be \nestablished and data from these points recorded. Items \nrelated to the major controllable losses should also be \nrecorded at this time, e.g., draft losses, air flows, burner \nsettings, steam flow, steam and feedwater temperatures, \nfuel flow and air temperatures.\nGiven the sophistication of today’s boiler controls \nand monitoring capabilities, tracking boiler and plant \nperformance is relatively easy. System operating \nparameters can be established that will automatically \nnotify operators or plant engineers when a deficiency \nexists that requires attention.\nProcedures for performance testing are provided in \nASME Performance Test Codes, PTC 4, Fired Steam \nGenerators; PTC 4.2, Coal Pulverizers; and PTC 4.3, \nAir Heaters.\nAbnormal operation\nLow water  If water level in the drum drops below the \nminimum required (as determined by the manufacturer), \nfuel firing should be stopped. Caution should be exercised \nwhen adding water to restore the drum level due to \nthe potential of temperature shock from the relatively \ncooler water coming in contact with hot drum metal. \nThermocouples on the top and bottom of the drum will \nindicate if the bottom of the drum is being rapidly cooled \nby feedwater addition, which would result in unacceptable \ntop-to-bottom temperature differentials. If water level \nindicators show there is still some water remaining in \nthe drum, then feedwater may be slowly added using the \nthermocouples as a guide. If the drum is completely empty, \nthen water may only be added periodically with soak \ntimes provided to allow drum temperature to equalize. \n(See Protection of drums and headers.)\nTube failures  Operating a boiler with a known tube \nleak is not recommended. Steam or water escaping from \na small leak can cut other tubes by impingement and \nset up a chain reaction of tube failures. From the loss of \nwater or steam, a tube failure can alter boiler circulation \nor flow and result in other circuits being overheated. \nThis is one reason why furnace risers on once-through \nboilers should be continuously monitored. A tube failure \nin the burner zone can also cause loss of ignition and a \nfurnace explosion if re-ignition occurs. As discussed later \nin the chapter, process recovery boilers are particularly \nsensitive to tube leaks due to the potential for smelt-water \nreactions, which can lead to boiler explosions.\nAny unusual increase in furnace riser temperature on \na once-through boiler is an indication of potential furnace \ntube leakage. Small leaks can sometimes be detected by \nthe loss of water from the system, the loss of chemicals \nfrom a drum boiler, or by the noise made by the leak. If a \nleak is suspected, the boiler should be shut down as soon \nas normal operating procedures permit. After the leak \nis located by hydrostatic testing, it should be repaired.\nSeveral items must be considered when a tube failure \noccurs.

When the fuel has been turned off, the \nfurnace should be purged of any combustible gases and \nfeedwater flow to the boiler should be stopped. The air \nflow should be reduced to a minimum as soon as the \nfurnace purge is completed. This procedure reduces the \nloss of boiler pressure and the corresponding drop in \nwater temperature within the boiler.\nThe firing rate or the flow of hot gases cannot be \nstopped immediately on some waste heat boilers or on \ncertain types of stoker-fired boilers. Several factors are \ninvolved in the decision to continue the flow of feedwater, \neven though the steam drum water level cannot be \nmaintained. In general, as long as the temperature of the \ncombustion gases is hot enough to damage the unit, the \nfeedwater flow should be continued. (See later discussion \nfor chemical recovery units.) The thermal shock resulting \nfrom feeding relatively cold feedwater into an empty \nsteam drum should also be considered. (See Protection \nof drums and headers.) Thermal shock is minimized if \nthe feedwater is hot, the unit has an economizer, and the \nfeedwater mixes with the existing boiler water.\nAfter the unit has been cooled, personnel should make \na complete inspection for evidence of overheating and for \nincipient cracks, especially to headers, drums and welded \nattachments. (See Personnel safety, especially when the \npotential of hot materials, boiler fluids or combustibles \nis present.)\nAn investigation of the tube failure is very important \nso that the condition(s) causing the tube failure can \nbe eliminated and future failures prevented. This \ninvestigation should include a careful visual inspection \nof the failed tube. In some cases, a laboratory analysis or \nconsideration of background information leading up to the \ntube failure is required. This information should include \nthe location of the failure, the length of time the unit has \nbeen in operation, load conditions, startup and shutdown \nconditions, feedwater treatment and internal deposits.\nShutdown operations\nBoiler shutdown is less complicated than startup. The \nemphasis again is on personnel safety and protection \nof equipment. Two shutdown situations may occur: a \ncontrolled shutdown or one required in an emergency.\nUnder controlled conditions, the firing rate is gradu­\nally reduced. Once the combustion equipment is brought \nto its minimum capacity, the fuel is shut off and the boiler \nis purged with fresh air. If pressure is to be maintained, \nthe fans are shut down and the dampers are closed. The \ndrum pressure gradually lowers as heat is lost from the \nboiler. A minimal amount of air drifts out of the stack. \nIf inspection and maintenance are required, the draft \nfans remain on to cool the boiler. If the unit is equipped \nwith a regenerative air heater, it is shut down, allowing \nthe boiler to cool faster. If a tubular air heater is present, \nthis heat trap can only be bypassed to help cool the boiler. \nThe cool down rate should not exceed 100F (56C) per hour \nof saturation temperature change to prevent damage to \npressure parts due to thermal stress.\nIn an emergency shutdown, the fuel is immediately \nshut off and the boiler is purged of combustible gases. \nAdditional procedures may apply to the fuel feed equip­\nment, such as inerting and clearing of coal pulverizers \nto avoid potential mill fires or explosions upon restart. \nThe boiler may be held at a reduced pressure or may be \ncompletely cooled as described above.\nOn/Off Cycling, Variable Pressure Operation\nOn/off cycling  Historically, boilers were often put \ninto operation and removed from load production because \nof system demand. This was especially true of small \nmunicipal plants which were subject to significant load \nreduction during the evening hours. Operators would \nremove the steam turbine generator from production, \nkeep it and the boiler warm through the night, and then \nhave the units ready for electrical production around \nsunrise. While the turbines were designed for this type \nof operation, the boilers, for the most part, were not.\nFrom the 1960s onward, as boiler and plant size \ngrew to meet increased electrical demand, most new \nutility boilers were designed for baseload operation (high \ncapacity over extended periods of time). The electrical \nsystems would then drop load across multiple units by a \nmodest amount to accommodate daily and seasonal load \nswings without excessive individual unit stress.\nWith the more recent removal from service of many \nsmaller steam boilers and turbine sets, as well as the \nincreased use of wind and other energy sources with \nvariable supply to the power grid, it has increasingly \nbecome necessary for power systems to cycle large units \nwhich were designed for baseload operation. This is not \nthe best practice for a steam generator that has not been \nspecifically designed to go through continued cooling and \nheating cycles. The stresses placed on the weld joints, \nheaders, drums and attachments between expanding \nand contracting parts, will cause failures after a finite \nnumber of cycles. Cycling operation will shorten the life \nspan of such equipment based on more cycles in a shorter \nperiod of time.\nAn operator must be aware of this and consider more \nextensive evaluation of parts and equipment to anticipate \npossible failures before they occur. Condition assessment \ntechniques, including both nondestructive and destructive \ntest procedures, were developed in the 1980s to address \nthese problems with older units and units that have been \nplaced into a cycling mode.1 (See Chapter 46.) A thorough \ncondition assessment program can reveal potential \nequipment modifications that can make the unit more \nflexible and alleviate possible problem areas. Technology \ndevelopments for the newest cycling units have made a \nwide variety of steam generator modifications available \nto be retrofitted to baseload designs.\nVariable pressure operation  It is beneficial to the \nefficiency of turbine/boiler operation to maintain open \nthrottle control valves when running the turbine genera­\ntor at low loads. This requires that the operator run the \nboiler at reduced pressure and maintain a high steam \ntemperature to the turbine for efficiency. With a drum \nboiler, this can be accomplished by placing a pressure \nreducing valve between the saturated steam outlet and \nthe superheater. This will allow the operator to run the \nboiler at high pressure and run the superheater at vari­\nable pressure. On a once-through unit, the operator can \nfollow these same procedures or can run the entire steam \ngenerator at varying pressure with load.

The path is through multiple \nparallel tube circuits arranged in series. Design and \nconstruction details are found in Chapters 19 and 26. This \ntype of boiler can be conceptualized as a long heated pipe \nwith continuous coolant flowing through it. As the fluid \nprogresses through the components, heat is absorbed from \nthe combustion process. The final steam temperature \nis dependent on the feedwater inlet temperature and \nratio of the fluid flow to the heat absorbed, which have \nimportant implications on unit operation. Any change to \nfuel characteristics and/or cleanliness of the heat transfer \nsurfaces throughout the unit changes the effective surface \nabsorption and could cause overheating of circuits.\nOperating practice\nB&W’s once-through steam generator, referred to \nas the universal pressure (UP®) boiler, has different \noperating characteristics than drum units. The UP boiler \nis capable of operating above the critical pressure point \n[3200 psi (22.1 MPa)] and can deliver steam pressure \nand temperature conditions without a steam-water \nseparation device after startup. The original UP boilers \nwere typically operated with constant pressure in the \nfurnace. The use of a pressure reducing valve allowed \nthe furnace to operate at constant pressure while the \nsuperheaters operated with variable pressure. To address \nthe increasing demand for operational flexibility and \nvariable pressure operation, the B&W spiral wound \nSWUP™ boiler is capable of variable pressure operation \nand on/off cycling, as well as load cycling and baseload \noperation. The spiral wound furnace design allows true \nvariable pressure operation and improves response time. \nThis spiral wound tube geometry UP boiler, including \nits startup and bypass systems, minimizes the thermal \nupsets during transients, allowing rapid load changes. \nThis is accomplished by forcing the flow of water around \nall four sides of the furnace until it leaves the first pass \nflow circuits above the burners and staged air ports. This \nallows a workable balance between heat input and fluid \ntemperature in each first pass tube circuit. Thus, an \nacceptable balance of metal temperature can be obtained \nwithout using orifices in each individual tube and/or \nmaintaining a set heat input balance by burner location \nselection when starting the unit and when varying \npressure in the furnace.\nB&W’s latest version of the once-through steam \ngenerator is the vertical tube UP boiler (VTUP™). This \nunit resembles the original vertical tube UP unit except \nfor the design of the tubes in the furnace. These specially \ndesigned ribbed tubes allow the mass flow through the \nfurnace to resemble that of a natural circulation boiler, \nbut with variable pressure operation from low loads \nat subcritical pressure to high loads at supercritical \npressure. This allows the operator to vary the pressure \nwith load change and maintain desired open position on \nthe turbine throttle valves to increase heat rate efficiency \nat all loads. This unit operates like a spiral wound unit \nand restores the unit to a vertical load support without \nstraps attached to the furnace walls in the lower first \npass section of the furnace. Like the spiral furnace, the \nVTUP is a two-pass furnace design to allow for balance \nof fluid temperature exiting the furnace.\nOnce-through boilers have both a superheater bypass \nsystem employing a steam-water separation device (flash \ntank or vertical steam separator), and steam turbine \nbypass valves for startup. The modern bypass systems are \nhighly automated and very effective in achieving smooth \noperation. The bypass systems are in service only during \nlow load operation.\nThe major functions that must be controlled are \nfuel, air, water and steam flows. These flows are highly \ninteractive placing unique constraints on the operation of \nthe unit. Though today’s integrated control systems can \nsimultaneously manage many operating functions, it is \nstill important for the operator to fully understand the \nrelationships between short-term (transient) and long-\nterm (steady state) energy transfer effects and to carefully \nmonitor and coordinate all control actions. Modern control \nsystems are often referred to as coordinated systems. (See \nChapter 42.) The combustion systems are conventional; \nthey are subject to the normal concerns of fuel utilization, \nefficiency and safety. \nThe operator has three main controls for operating \na UP boiler:\n1.\t \tfiring rate,\n2.\t \tfeedwater flow control, and\n3.\t \tsteam flow/steam pressure.\nFiring rate  The long-term demand for firing rate \nis directly proportional to load. The short-term effects \nof firing rate impact steam temperature and pressure. \nDuring increases in firing rate the steam temperature \nincreases until the feedwater flow is increased to com­\npensate and balance the new firing rate. Steam pressure \nincreases in a similar fashion to that of a drum boiler. In \na supercritical pressure application, there is no large rise \nin specific volume during the transition from liquid to \nvapor conditions. However, there is still a large increase \nin specific volume as a supercritical fluid is heated. With \nthis expansion, the turbine control valves are opened and \nflow is increased to maintain pressure. With the many \ninteractions that are a consequence of firing rate, the \noperator and automated control system must coordinate \nthe firing rate, feedwater flow and turbine control valve \nposition to match electrical load demand. The speed of \nreaction of all the variable control loops must be properly \ntuned to control main steam outlet temperature and \npressure and reheat outlet steam temperature.\nFeedwater flow  On all once-through units during \nsteady-state conditions, the outlet steam temperature is \ndependent on the ratio of feedwater flow rate to firing rate. \nOn variable pressure units it is desirable to position firing \nrate based on electrical demand, and therefore, feedwater \nflow control is based on outlet steam temperature. The \nshort-term effect of feedwater flow changes is to increase \nor decrease steam pressure and electrical load. The load \n", "char_count": 6547, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_44", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Boiler Operations", "is_complete_section": true}}

However, this load change is transitory. Pressure \nis a measure of the balance between steam flow and \nfeedwater flow. The outlet pressure is constant if they \nare matched. The operator can, therefore, use feedwater \nto assist in recovery from transients and upsets, but \nultimately must match feedwater flow with firing rate to \nachieve the desired outlet steam temperature. On a once-\nthrough unit that operates at constant outlet pressure \nand uses the turbine control valves for load changes, the \nfiring rate is usually used to control superheater steam \ntemperature to the turbine and the feedwater controls \nfollow the steam flow and/or hold outlet pressure at a \nset point.\nSteam flow/steam pressure  In steady-state condi­\ntion on all once-through units, total steam flow (sum of all \nsteam flow to the turbine and all auxiliaries if in use, such \nas sootblowers) is the same as total feedwater flow to the \neconomizer and any attemperators in use. In a constant \npressure UP boiler, the boiler pressure is determined by \nturbine throttle valve position. To increase electrical load, \nthe turbine throttle valves are opened, decreasing steam \npressure which temporarily increases steam flow to the \nturbine. This is because decreasing back pressure on the \nboiler at a constant firing rate and constant feedwater \nflow allows the mass to expand, temporarily resulting \nin more steam flow. This is not a lasting effect, however, \nbecause steam flow will begin to drop unless feedwater \nflow and firing rate are increased to restore throttle \npressure at the new load.\nOn a variable pressure once-through unit, load is \nchanged while holding the turbine throttle valve posi­\ntion within tight limits and increasing the firing rate \nand feedwater flow. This increases boiler and throttle \npressure with the increased steam flow to the turbine \nfor electrical load increase. This load change is a result \nof increasing energy into the boiler in the form of heat \nand pressure. Thus, feedwater flow is manipulated to \ncontrol steam temperature and load, but ultimately must \nbe controlled to achieve the desired operating pressure on \nvariable pressure units. Superheater attemperator sprays \ncorrect for upset conditions of temperature exiting the \nsecondary superheater, but once the pressure and steam \nflow to the turbine balance out for a set position of the \nthrottle valves, the feedwater flow should be adjusted to \nreduce the attemperator spray flows to the prescribed \namount to prevent overheating of the furnace circuits at \nthe new firing rate.\nOperating skills\nEfficiency   The supercritical boiler provides high \ncycle efficiency. Efficiency can be maintained throughout \nthe life of the boiler with sufficient instrumentation and \npreventive maintenance. Operators must be thoroughly \ntrained to know the optimum operating parameters of \nall the equipment in the power plant. Deviations from \nthese parameters can then be addressed by instrument \nmaintenance, direct operator action (such as sootblowing) \nor an engineering investigation. Performance tests \nshould be conducted on a regular basis and compared \nto baseline test results. Performance variances should \nbe investigated to determine corrective actions to bring \nthe unit back to peak efficiency. Besides the conventional \nneed to minimize heat losses, these tests can be used to \nconfirm control system calibration. Test results should \nbe reviewed with the operators.\nStartup systems  Chapter 19 provides a comprehen­\nsive overview of the configuration and operation of state-\nof-the-art startup and bypass systems for variable and \nconstant furnace pressure once-through boiler systems. \nSystems for UP boilers have evolved as the understanding \nand experience of the once-through concept have been \ngained. A key requirement for the startup system is to \nmaintain adequate flow in the furnace walls (30% for \nmost variable pressure supercritical units, 25% for most \nconstant pressure supercritical units, and 33% for most \nsubcritical units) to protect them from overheating during \nstartup and low load operation. First generation designs \nsimply bypassed any excess flow from the furnace, not \nrequired for the turbine power generation, directly to the \ncondenser from the high pressure turbine inlet. Second \ngeneration startup systems added a steam-water separa­\ntion device called a flash tank (including steam-water \nseparation equipment) after the convection pass enclosure \ncircuits, but upstream of the primary superheater. This \npermitted the generation of dry steam for turbine roll \nand synchronization. The flash tank effectively operated \nas a small steam drum. (See Fig. 2.) Once the steam \nturbine-generator is synchronized, load can be increased, \nthe flash tank bypass closed, and the unit operated in \nfull once-through conditions.\nThird generation constant pressure designs moved \nthe bypass line and added necessary valves (200 and \n201) downstream of the primary superheater so that the \nprimary superheater is always in the initial flow circuit. \n(See Fig. 3 for key elements.)\nIn fourth generation designs, steam is produced in \nthe flash tank because the pressure reducing valve (207 \nin Fig. 3) drops the pressure from supercritical to ap­\nproximately 1000 psig (6.89 MPa). For a smooth transition \nfrom startup (flash tank) to once-through operation, the \nenthalpy of the flash tank steam must be matched with \nFig. 2  Second generation UP startup system schematic.\n", "char_count": 5667, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_44", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Boiler Operations", "is_complete_section": true}}

Because the flash tank \ngenerally operates at 1000 psig (6.89 MPa), the throttle \npressure to the turbine can be ramped to full pressure \nonce the flash tank has been bypassed.\nBased on an operating plant’s need to vary load during \na 24-hour period, as well as changes in seasonal load \nrequirements, it is more efficient to maintain maximum \nopen position on the turbine throttle valves and vary the \nsteam generator outlet pressure with constant steam tem­\nperature. With B&W’s SWUP and VTUP supercritical \nsteam generators, the bypass system has been modified to \nallow subcritical operation at low loads and supercritical \noperation at high loads. This increases overall heat rate \nefficiency for the individual boiler turbine set. The bypass \nsystems have been changed to incorporate features of the \nsubcritical drum unit and the supercritical once-through \nstartup systems. As shown in Fig. 4 (key elements only), \nthe SWUP and VTUP operating system has evolved from \nthe second generation system shown in Fig. 2. The flash \ntank has been replaced with vertical steam separators, \na water collection tank and a boiler circulation pump. \nDuring startup and low load operation, the flow from the \nfurnace passes through the vertical steam separators \nwhere steam is removed and sent to the superheater \nand water is discharged to the water collection tank. \nWater then flows through the boiler circulation pump \nto maintain the minimum furnace wall circulation. \nAny excess water accumulated during startup is sent to \nthe condenser through the 341 valves. When unit load \nreaches a point where the sum of the furnace flow plus the \nattemperator spray flow is equal to the main steam flow \nrate, once-through operation is achieved, the 381 valves \nare closed, and the boiler circulation pump is shut down.\nLimits and precautions  The once-through nature of \nUP boilers results in special limits and precautions that \nmust be observed for safe and reliable operation:\n1.\t \tFeedwater conductivity (cleanliness) — unlike a drum \nboiler which can remove suspended solids through \nblowdown, all hardness and other contaminants \nthat enter a once-through boiler in the feedwater are \ndeposited on the water side of the heating surface or \nin the superheater. Deposition can lead to overheating \nand tube failures. Boiler firing must be stopped if \nwater conductivity exceeds 2.0 microsiemens (mS) \nfor five minutes or if it exceeds 5.0 microsiemens for \ntwo minutes. The operator should be trained in water \nquality control requirements. (See Chapter 43.)\n2.\t \tMinimum feedwater flow — firing is not permitted \nunless the boiler feedwater flow is above the specified \nminimum. The boiler is to be immediately shut down \nif flow falls below 85% of minimum for twenty seconds \nor 70% of minimum for one second.\n3.\t \tFeedwater temperature — the heat input required \nper unit of water flow is dependent on the difference \nbetween the feedwater inlet temperature and the \ncontrolled outlet steam temperature. If feedwater \ntemperature entering the unit is reduced below design \nat any given load and the outlet steam temperature \nis maintained, then the maximum allowable heat \ninput to the furnace may be exceeded. This may \nresult in damage to the tube material. For units \nthat were not designed for a feedwater heater out of \nservice, removal of a feedwater heater will require \nthat the final steam temperature be reduced to hold \nfurnace heat input rates within design limits. Unless \nspecific information is provided, the general rule is to \nreduce steam temperature one degree F for every two \ndegrees F that the feedwater temperature is below the \nminimum design requirement.\n4.\t \tExceeding design heat input at a given load (overfir­\ning) — for supercritical units, the fluid in the furnace \nhas no latent heat of vaporization as in a subcritical \nboiler. Consequently, as heat is absorbed, the fluid \ntemperature is always increasing and the furnace \ntube metal temperatures increase. Firing in excess \nof design rates can result in excessive tube metal \ntemperatures in select furnace locations.

A maximum of 1.15 times the steady-state rate \nis a typical guideline. This rate, at various load condi­\ntions, should be clearly established by combustion \ntests.\n5.\t \tTube leaks — operation with a tube leak is not \nrecommended on any boiler. For once-through units, \nthe situation is more critical because the leakage can \nreduce cooling flow to subsequent tubes or circuits \ndownstream. \n6.\t \tLow pressure limit — a constant pressure supercriti­\ncal UP boiler must be tripped if the fluid pressure \nin the furnace falls below 3200 psig (22.1 MPa) for \nfifteen seconds. Failure to do so can result in improper \ncircuit flow, inadequate tube cooling and furnace tube \nfailures. For SWUP and VTUP boilers, the units are \ndesigned for specific variable pressure ramps. To avoid \npossible tube damage, the units must operate along \ndesign pressure ramp curves.\nOperation of Fluidized-Bed Boilers\nThe growth rate of electric power demand in the U.S. \nhas slowed considerably. Thus, the need for new, large \nutility-operated units has decreased. Coupled with \nenvironmental regulations, it has become economically \nfeasible to use lower capacity fluidized-bed boilers to meet \nsmall localized increases in process steam and electrical \npower needs.\nChapter 17 provides a detailed discussion of fluidized-\nbed combustion systems. The following sections describe \ngeneral fluidized-bed boiler operation, both circulating \nfluidized-bed (CFB) systems and bubbling fluidized-bed \n(BFB) systems.\nCFB systems overview\nThe CFB is constructed and performs similar to a \nconventional drum boiler. However, thermal performance, \ncombustion efficiency, furnace absorption pattern and SO2 \ncontrol are strongly influenced by the mass of solids in the \nbed (inventory), the size distribution of the bed material \n(bed sizing), and the circulating rate of the bed (flow rate). \nBulk bed density is a measure of the material weight per \nunit volume. There is a higher density and inventory in \nthe lower furnace, made of coarser particles (average size \n200 to 400 micron), and a lower density and inventory in \nthe upper furnace (also called furnace shaft) made of finer \nparticles (average size 100 to 200 micron). Fig. 5 shows \nthe density of the bed with respect to furnace height and \nindicates the effect of load.\nTo integrate these influences into operating proce­\ndures, the CFB is equipped with additional instrumenta­\ntion which provides operator input for bed management. \nThese inputs are as follows:\n1.\t \tPrimary zone ∆P — The gas-side differential pressure \nis measured across the primary furnace zone [from the \nair distribution grid to an intermediate elevation of \nabout 7 ft (2.1 m) above the grid] and is an indication \nof the coarser bed inventory. This variable is managed \nby controlling the bed drain flow.\n2.\t \tShaft ∆P — The furnace shaft ∆P, from the intermedi­\nate elevation to the furnace roof, indicates the shaft \nbed density and is managed to follow boiler load with \ncorrections for primary zone temperature control. It is \ninfluenced by the multi-cyclone dust collector (MDC) \nrecycle rate, the primary to secondary air split, and \nexcess air setting.\n3.\t \tLower bed (or primary zone) temperature — The lower \nbed temperature is set by the operator as a primary \ncontrol variable for optimal combustion and emission \nperformance. The shaft ∆P, primary to secondary air \nsplit, and excess air controls are used to control this \noperating parameter.\nThese variables are typically not available on pulver­\nized coal-fired boilers. However, the overall operation is \nsimilar. Fuel feed is set by steam requirements, total air \nflow is adjusted to follow fuel flow, and excess air is set \nto optimize combustion and unit efficiency. Shaft bed \ndensity is then predominantly used to control the lower \nbed temperature, the most important variable on a CFB \nboiler. The lower bed temperature is usually controlled \nto a fuel-dependent set temperature [for example 1550F \n(843C) for lignite and 1620F (882C) for petroleum coke] \nwhich results in optimal combustion efficiency and SO2 \nabsorption. The optimum bed operating temperature \nfrom combustion and emission standpoints is from 1500 \nto 1650F (816 to 899C), depending on the fuel.\nAnother variable that is controlled somewhat differ­\nently in a CFB is the air admission to the furnace. The \ntotal air flow is divided into primary and secondary \nflows. Because total air flow is based on fuel flow, the \nprimary to secondary air split becomes another important \nparameter affecting emissions and bed temperature. The \nsplit affects the lower bed density, shaft density, and \ncontrol of the primary zone temperature. The optimum \nair split is determined as a function of steam flow during \ncommissioning tests. Once the optimum primary to \nsecondary air split (as a function of steam flow) has been \ndetermined for automated control, the operator should not \nneed to independently manipulate the split.\nSolids management is also unique to CFBs. Once the \nbed material inventory has been established, bed inven­\ntory is maintained by the fuel ash and sorbent-derived \nFig. 5  Typical bed density profile for a circulating fluidized bed.\n", "char_count": 5268, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_44", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Boiler Operations", "is_complete_section": true}}

Any change in inventory \nnecessary to accommodate load change comes from the \nMDC hoppers. In the case of firing low ash and low sulfur \nfuels, solids input with fuel ash and sorbent may not be \nadequate to provide enough bed material for furnace \ntemperature control. This also may be the case when \nfiring waste fuels requiring a high bed drain rate for \nremoving oversized material, e.g., rocks. If a shortage \nof solids for maintaining bed inventory occurs, the first \nsource to add bed material would be recycling a usable \nportion (properly sized material) from the lower furnace \nbed drain. If this is not sufficient, inert bed material fed \nfrom an external source, e.g., sand, would be provided. \nWith the sometimes complex relationships where \nchanges in one variable impact several temperatures and \nflows, control logics are provided to automatically control \nthese interrelating parameters with minimal, if any, \noperator actions needed. However, the operator must be \ntrained to understand these relationships and to control \nupsets to establish and maintain stability if necessary.\nFuel sizing and fuel characteristics\nCoal firing  Fuel sizing is very important to successful \nboiler operation. It impacts the furnace heat release \nprofile; fine particles tend to burn higher in the furnace \nshaft while coarse particles burn predominantly in the \nprimary zone. For medium and high ash fuels, fuel sizing \nalso impacts sizing of bed particles and, correspondingly, \nbottom ash to flyash split. When fuel variation occurs, \nthe operator should be thoroughly trained on the required \nadjustments if the variations are outside the range of the \nprogrammed control logics. \nBiomass firing  Biomass fuels provide a particular \nchallenge in CFB operations because of continuous \nvariations in size, shape, moisture content, and heating \ncharacteristics. To minimize operating problems, fuel \nsources should be continuously blended to achieve the \nmost uniform consistency possible. This usually takes \nplace in the fuel storage area where the fuel is introduced \nto the system. Different fuel types should be stored \nseparately so the fuels can be blended at varying rates \nto control furnace combustion performance. Modest \ninventories are needed—large enough to permit blending \nfor uniformity of feed but not large enough to result in \nexcessive inventory storage times. Bed material sizing \nshould be checked on a regular basis to ensure that the \nbed material is not deteriorating. Care must be taken \nin such sampling procedures because of the high bed \nmaterial temperature.\nStartup and shutdown considerations  Chapter \n17 provides general guidelines for the startup of CFBs. \nHot and cold startup conditions are distinguished by the \ntemperature of the furnace solids inventory, either higher \nor lower than the auto-ignition temperature of the main \nfuel established at the end of the boiler purge sequence. \nAs with any boiler, prior to startup and after shutdown \nthe unit must be purged according to the latest applicable \nNFPA Codes. An important part of a cold startup is the \nwarming of the bed material with auxiliary fuel overbed \nburners designed for this purpose. During normal \noperation, a CFB is loaded with enough bed material to \nprovide a 20 in. wg (5 kPa) pressure differential across the \nprimary zone. During the warming process, bed materials \nare introduced to raise the bed pressure drop from 5 in. \nwg (1.25 kPa). Auxiliary fuel is used to increase and \nstabilize the primary zone temperature at about 1000F \n(538C) in preparation for main fuel introduction. This \ntemperature varies somewhat depending on the main \nfuel. Simultaneously, the boiler metal temperatures as \nindicated by steam pressure (saturation temperature) \nmust be within the heatup rate allowed for the boiler pres­\nsure parts. Upon ignition of the auxiliary fuel, the flue gas \ntemperature entering the U-beams and the steam-cooled \nsurfaces must be monitored and maintained below 950F \n(510C) until 10% of the MCR steam flow is established \nthrough the steam-cooled circuits. Once the primary zone \ntemperature is stabilized at the fuel auto-ignition point, \nthe main fuel is introduced and the bed temperature \ncan be gradually raised to about 1500F (816C) where \nthe auxiliary burner may be shut off. Boiler load can be \nincreased from this low load operation with circulating \nmode being established with increasing solids, fuel and \nair flow. The rate of increase must be controlled such that \nthe bed temperature remains stable. Primary air to total \nair ratio is further adjusted to improve combustion and \nreduce emissions.\nOverbed burners are used to assist with the vola­\ntilization of unburned carbon particles in the primary \nzone of the furnace. If the boiler is being shut down for \nmaintenance and personnel entry into the boiler setting is \nrequired, then the fuel entering the bed should be stopped. \nAll the carbon in the bed should be burned out for safety \nreasons. Then all solids must be completely removed from \nthe boiler and hoppers, and the boiler temperature must \nbe below 120F (49C) prior to entry. (See Personnel safety \ndiscussed earlier.)\nBFB systems overview\nLike its CFB counterpart, bed management of a BFB \nis important. Bed inventory, bed sizing, makeup and \ndrainage must be integrated into operating procedures \nfrom data collected during commissioning tests. The \nBFB is also equipped with additional instrumentation \nto assist the operator in developing the unit-specific \noperating guidelines.\n1.\t \tPrimary zone ∆P — the gas-side differential pressure \nis used as an indication of bed height. The primary \nzone may be compartmented on the air side for coal \nfiring, and multiple ∆P cells are then displayed.\n2.\t \tBed temperature — the typical bed temperature \noperating range is 1400 to 1600F (760 to 871C) and \nis a primary control variable. Because the control of \nthis variable is critical, multiple thermocouples are \ninstalled in the bed and are averaged and compared \nto a bed temperature set point.\nThe operation of a BFB is similar to that of other \ncombustion technologies in that fuel and air demands are \nset by the required steaming conditions. Bed temperature \nis controlled within the desired range by adjusting the \nratio of flue gas recirculation (FGR) to pure air flow \nsplits for biomass firing. This same procedure is used \nfor coal firing (see Chapter 17) in addition to taking \ncompartments of the bed into and out of service based on \nload demand (slumping). If a sorbent is used in the bed for \nSO2 control, it is usually metered in proportion to the fuel \nflow. Various interactions can occur when manipulating \n", "char_count": 6783, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_44", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Boiler Operations", "is_complete_section": true}}

These responses include:\n1.\t \tFuel flow control — fuel feed is increased or decreased \nbased on steaming requirements. Changes in fuel \nfeed have a short-term impact on bed temperature \nbecause of the massive heat sink of inert material \nin the bed. Therefore, if the fuel gets too wet (high \nin moisture), FGR flow to the bed will be decreased \nand pure air flow will be increased. If all of the FGR \nflow to the bed is removed and the bed temperature \nis still decreasing, the startup burners may be needed \nto restore bed temperature. If the fuel is too dry and/\nor the Btu value exceeds design parameters, the pure \nair flow will be decreased and the FGR flow will be \nincreased.\n2.\t \tBed height — height is controlled by adding material \nfrom the makeup system or by removing material \nthrough the drain system. \n3.\t \tAir control — total air is primarily controlled based on \nsteam flow. The total air flow is the sum of the pure \nair to the bed, the pure air to the fuel chutes, and the \nair to the overfire air ports. Air may be biased by the \noperator to change bed conditions. Increasing primary \nor bed air at a given load increases bed turbulence \nand burnout in the bed, while the overfire air changes \nopposite to the bed air change to control constant total \nair at a given load. Reducing bed air at a given load \nwould have the opposite effect. The operator must, \ntherefore, bias the set point based on combustion \nconditions. There are minimum and maximum air \nflow and air/FGR flow limits to the bed to ensure that \nthere is enough air to sustain the combustion process \nwhile not under or over fluidizing the bed. Fuel sizing \nvariations, moisture content, and higher heating value \nare most likely to influence combustion conditions.\n4.\t \tBed material flow — material flow to the primary \nzone is through makeup and bed drains. These are \ngenerally intermittent devices, so the operator must \nobserve trends in height and temperature, and make \nappropriate adjustments. Most BFB boilers have a \nbed material reclaim system. This system screens \nthe bed material that is drained from the boiler and \nreclaims the properly sized material while removing \nagglomerations and tramp material.\nFuel sizing  Careful attention to fuel sizing (minimum \nand maximum) is critical to successful unit operation for \nboth under-bed and over-bed feed systems. Finer particles \nare elutriated too quickly and coarser particles tend to \ntake too long to burn completely. In either case, UBC and \nSO2 emissions (if being controlled) both increase. Finer \nparticles increase NOx emissions and bed temperature \nbecause the fuel is burning in suspension. An optimum \nsize range exists for each fluidized-bed system and fuel \ntype. The proper size range is fine tuned through unit \noperating practice. In addition, for the over-bed feed \nsystem, fuel size interacts with screw speed, angle of \ninjection, and furnace gas velocity.\nStartup and shutdown considerations  Hot and cold \nstartups are determined by the temperature of the bed. \nIf the bed is above the minimum ignition temperature, \nthen a hot restart can be performed. If the bed is below \nthe minimum ignition temperature, a cold startup is \nrequired. In accordance with the latest applicable NFPA \nCodes, a boiler purge must occur prior to a cold startup \nand after a shutdown. A hot restart does not require a \npurge.\nThe four main steps of a cold startup are: 1) performing \na pre-operational checkout, 2) purging the boiler, 3) \nstarting the burners (startup burners and load burners if \napplicable), and 4) firing with solid fuel. Prior to starting \nup the boiler, the bubble caps must be covered with bed \nmaterial to prevent overheating. The bed height, when \nslumped and prior to startup, should be 24 in. (610 mm) \nabove the bubble caps. As with any boiler during startup, \nthe boiler metal temperature curve must be within the \nheatup rate allowed for the boiler pressure parts.\nThe startup burners are used to bring the bed \ntemperature up to the minimum ignition temperature \nso that solid fuel can be introduced. Once solid fuel is \ncombusting properly in the bed and the bed temperature is \nabove the low-alarm set point, the startup burners can be \ntaken out of service. The boiler load can then be increased \nuntil MCR is reached. However, the rate of increase must \nbe controlled to maintain a stable bed temperature.\nDuring normal shutdown, the boiler is brought to a \nminimum load. At that point, there are two options: 1) \nquickly cool the boiler to prepare it for an extended offline \nperiod, or 2) completely isolate the boiler for a shorter \ndowntime. In both cases the boiler must be purged to \nremove all volatiles from the furnace and to burn all \nremaining fuel in the bed. Once the purge is complete, \nthe fans can remain running until the unit is sufficiently \ncooled (option 1) or the fans can be tripped while closing \nthe dampers to conserve the temperature of the bed and \nrefractory (option 2).\nOperation of Cyclone Furnaces\nB&W originally designed and supplied steam \ngenerators with Cyclone furnaces to fire low ash fusion \ntemperature bituminous coals in a steam generator \nfor greater steam flow at higher pressures and steam \ntemperatures. At the time, its design also addressed \nthe need to significantly reduce particulate stack \nemissions by removing most of the ash from the bottom \nof the furnace as cooled granular ash with almost no \nunburned carbon. The Cyclone furnace in this boiler is \na water-cooled chamber designed to burn crushed coal. \nThe basic design, sizing and general operation of Cyclone \nfurnaces are covered in Chapter 15. The key feature that \naffects operations is the collection of most of the coal \nash as a liquid slag in the Cyclone chamber. This slag \nis continuously tapped into the main furnace through a \nhole at the discharge end of the Cyclone barrel. The slag \ncollects on the furnace floor and flows through a tap into \na water filled tank where the chilling effect of the water \nleaves the slag in granular form. Unique operational \nissues center upon maintaining desired furnace slag \ntapping without excessive maintenance.\nFuels\nA key operating parameter of Cyclone units is the \nselection of a proper coal. Fuels acceptable for Cyclone \nfiring must generally meet the following specifications \nsubject to site-specific conditions:\n", "char_count": 6522, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_44", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Boiler Operations", "is_complete_section": true}}

This is especially \nimportant for subbituminous coals, where the higher \nmoisture content requires a finer coal grind to maintain \nCyclone temperatures and to minimize unburned carbon \nin the flyash.\nCombustion air\nAll Cyclone furnaces use heated air at a high static \npressure. The air temperature ranges from 500 to 750F \n(260 to 399C), depending on the unit design and the rank \nof the fuel. The static differential across the Cyclone \n(pressure drop as measured from the upstream side of the \nsecondary air compartment damper, or velocity damper, \nto the main furnace pressure) ranges from 32 to 50 in. \nwg (8 to 12.5 kPa). This high pressure produces the very \nhigh velocities which, in turn, produce the scrubbing \naction required for complete combustion of the crushed \ncoal while retaining it within the Cyclone barrel.\nA key variable in Cyclone operation is excess air. For \nbituminous coals, which are generally high in sulfur \nand iron content, 10 to 14% excess air is recommended \nat full load operation. This can be reduced to 6 to 8% on \nsome eastern bituminous coals with well managed air \nflow controls. Operation at lower excess air can promote \nan oxygen-deficient reducing atmosphere, which can \nsignificantly increase unit maintenance on higher \niron content coals. Operation with molten slag under \nsubstoichiometric conditions can result in iron sulfide \nattack (corrosion) of the Cyclone tubes. When operated \nwith insufficient excess air, fuels with high iron content \ncan smelt the iron from the ash. A pig iron, which forms a \nstrong bond to the boiler tubing, can form and may result \nin tube damage during deposit removal.\nOperation with high levels of excess air leads to lower \nthermal efficiency and results in Cyclone cooling. This \nhinders slag tapping. On units with multiple Cyclone \nfurnaces, it is important to accurately measure the \nsecondary air and coal flow to ensure that each Cyclone \nis operating with the proper air-fuel ratio. Because proper \nexcess air is essential, theoretical air curves should be \nused to readjust the excess air levels when individual \nCyclone furnaces are removed from service.\nFiring subbituminous coals is generally more difficult \nfor two basic reasons: 1) the fuel is generally higher in \nmoisture content which must be evaporated leading to \nreduced heat available for maintaining molten slag, \nand 2) the ash fusion temperature of the coal is more \ntemperature sensitive which results in tighter operating \nmargins for acceptable slag flow. Units designed for \nsubbituminous coal firing have provisions for higher \nprimary and secondary air temperature and are generally \nrun with 10 to 12% excess air.\nDue to environmental concerns, some bituminous \ncoal-fired Cyclone furnaces have been converted to \nburn low sulfur subbituminous coal or coal blends. \nSubbituminous coal may have lower ash content than \nmost bituminous coals. As a result, less slag is available \nto trap the raw coal particles. This, combined with the \ndepressed flame temperature caused by the increased \nmoisture content, can result in less coal being entrapped \nin the slag where the combustion is completed. Thus, when \nfiring subbituminous coal, it is suggested that the coal \nfineness be increased to 99% passing through a number \n4 standard U.S. sieve compared to 95% for harder to burn \nbituminous coal.\nBecause the Cyclone furnace is designed to operate \nat a high temperature of combustion in the presence of \nexcess air, it is a high producer of NOx emissions. Acting \non the additional environmental concerns, owners have \ninstalled OFA systems for combustion NOx control. While \nfurnace wall corrosion remains a concern, worthwhile \nNOx reductions have been attained with fuel-rich \nstoichiometry and lower sulfur fuels. Typically, units \nthat have been retrofitted with OFA systems operate at \nslightly higher overall excess air levels as compared to \nthe baseline levels previously identified. To achieve lower \nNOx emissions, SCR systems can be installed.\nWhen firing higher moisture subbituminous coal, it is \nalso preferred to use higher transport air temperatures.\nAs the moisture content reaches the 20% range at \ndesign Cyclone fuel inputs, clinkering and UBC in the \nCyclone and on the furnace floor can increase dramati­\ncally. Levels of unburned carbon also increase in the ash \nin the economizer, air heater and precipitator hoppers. \nSupplemental firing with fuel oil or natural gas along \nwith design changes may be required if the unit was not \noriginally designed for this condition.\n", "char_count": 5302, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_44", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Boiler Operations", "is_complete_section": true}}

This is accomplished by the use of \na pre-dry system, as discussed in Chapter 15. In this \nsystem, hot air [750F (399C)] is introduced to the raw \ncoal stream prior to crushing in a pressurized and heated \nconditioner. The hot air-coal mixture then travels to a \ncyclone separator, where the saturated air and some coal \nfines are separated from the coal stream and are injected \ninto the lower furnace. The dried coal is then carried by \na lift line to the Cyclone burner.\nOperation of Kraft Recovery Boilers\nOverview\nThe Kraft recovery boiler’s main purpose in the \npulping process is to reduce the sulfate compounds to \nreusable sodium sulfide for the cooking of the wood \nchips in the digester to make pulp for the production of \npaper products. Through this process, the chemicals are \nrecovered to reduce costs and protect the environment.\nAlong with the recovery of chemicals, the recovery \nboiler has two additional purposes: 1) to efficiently \nrecover heat from burning the liquor to generate steam \nfor process use, and 2) to operate in an environmentally \nresponsible manner, cooling the combustion gases to \nallow particulate collection and minimize the discharge \nof objectionable gases.\nUnlike conventional power boilers and other types of \nheat recovery processes, the Kraft (black liquor) boiler is \nnot designed to mix the combustion portion of the fuel with \ncombustion air in the primary portion of the furnace for \ncomplete combustion. It is designed to dry the moisture \nfrom the fuel and provide enough heat to facilitate the \nreduction of sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) to sodium sulfide \n(Na2S).\nSteam flows from large recovery boilers can exceed \n1,000,000 lb/h (126 kg/s) at superheater outlet pressures \nas high as 1550 psi (10.7 MPa) and final steam tempera­\ntures of up to 950F (510C). These units burn black liquor \nwith solids contents up to 80% and with heating values \nat about 5500 to 6600 Btu/lb (12,793 to 15,352 kJ/kg). A \ndetailed review of designs and general operating practice \nis provided in Chapter 28. Selected operating issues are:\n1.\t \tblack liquor combustion process and air flow,\n2.\t \tauxiliary burners,\n3.\t \toperating problems, and\n4.\t \tsmelt-water reactions.\nBlack liquor combustion process and air flow\nUnlike the firing of conventional fossil fuels, recovery \nboiler combustion goes through several distinct stages. \nBlack liquor firing is composed of drying, volatile burn­\ning, volatilization of the fixed carbon (char), and smelt \ncoalescence. This has a distinct impact on unit operation \nand air addition. All modern B&W recovery boilers are \nequipped with three levels of combustion air. These are \nknown as the primary, secondary and tertiary air streams \nin order of increasing elevation in the furnace. Additional \ncombustion air levels can be added individually or in \ncombination, including more levels of tertiary air for NOx \nreduction, and a liquor air level adjacent to the liquor \nsprays for particulate reduction when burning higher \nsolids liquor. (See Chapter 28.)\nPrimary air  Primary air is in the lowest zone in a \nrecovery boiler furnace. The air ports are located ap­\nproximately 3 ft (0.9 m) above the furnace floor. Admitted \non all four walls of the boiler, the primary air provides \nperimeter air around the bed at low velocity and low \npenetration, so the boiler does not lose continuous ignition \nof combustion. The primary air is critical to bed stability, \nbed temperature and reduction efficiency. Primary air \nshould be sufficient to burn the volatiles and heat the char \nso that it will begin to volatilize and self ignite and draw \nits oxygen from the surrounding salt cake (Na2SO4). The \nheat released when this part of the elemental carbon is \nburned will then give heat to the surrounding char and \nsalt cake to allow the reduction process to take place in the \nbottom of the furnace and in the char bed by conduction \nof heat and distillation burning.\nPrimary air velocity and distribution is vital for \noptimum bed stability. A required quantity of primary \nair flow with sufficient momentum is introduced to the \nfurnace hearth to promote adequate bed temperature \nfor chemical reduction. The required primary air flow is \nbased on the liquor properties which affect the desired \nliquor spray characteristics required for a particular \nfurnace and include droplet size, droplet velocity and \nspray distribution.\nSecondary air  High pressure secondary air on newer \nunits is designed to penetrate the full cross-section of the \nunit. On older units with numerous, small secondary \nair ports on all four walls, the jet penetration will be \nlimited. It is admitted at approximately 8 ft (2.4 m) \nabove the furnace floor for combustion air to ignite the \nCO gas coming off of the char burning in the lower bed. \nThis releases heat to this zone of the furnace to dry black \nliquor droplets and support pyrolysis (or volatile burning).\nExperience gained from numerical modeling and \noperating trials has shown that a single level of secondary \nair introduced in an interlaced pattern approximately \n10 ft (3.1 m) below the liquor guns and about 4 ft (1.2 \nm) above the primary air ports provides the optimum \nuse of secondary air to support combustion. Optimum \njet penetration from each of the ports is controlled by a \nvelocity damper. This arrangement promotes the proper \ndrying of the liquor through combustion of the pyrolysis \ngases without interference from the secondary air jets \nand prepares the material reaching the hearth to interact \nwith primary air for maximum chemical reduction.\nA properly adjusted recovery boiler will maintain bed \nsize by the proper drying of liquor falling to the hearth \nthrough the secondary air jets. The formation of a large \nbed where the secondary air jets are directly impacting \nbed material is not desirable and is an indication of \ninadequate hearth and char temperature. In some cases \na bed can become so unstable that combustion ceases to \nbe self-sustaining resulting in sticky, hard regions of the \nbed that are no longer active. This can lead to a blackout \ncondition when the inactive areas become large enough. \nThis condition can be confirmed by a sharp drop in steam \ngeneration. The operator may find it necessary to add \nauxiliary fuel firing, stop liquor firing, and burn out the \nunacceptable bed material to regain control of the hearth \nconditions before attempting to resume black liquor firing.\n", "char_count": 6583, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_44", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Boiler Operations", "is_complete_section": true}}
{"chunk_id": "unit_001_page_020", "page_number": 20, "text": "44-20\nSteam 42 / Boiler Operations\nThe Babcock & Wilcox Company\nTertiary air  All recovery boilers provide between 50 \nto 90% of total combustion air to the ports that are located \nbelow the liquor spray nozzle level. The remaining air \nrequired to complete the oxidation of sulfur compounds \nand CO is introduced at one or more air levels above the \nliquor spray nozzles. The elevation of these tertiary ports \nis approximately 10 ft (3.1 m) above the liquor spray nozzle \nelevation to avoid interference and entrainment of the \nliquor sprays which can cause carryover.\nIn some cases, two levels of vertically aligned tertiary \nports are utilized to take advantage of the reinforcing \neffect of air jets in that closely spaced arrangement. The \ntertiary port sizing is set by similar criteria used for the \nsecondary air ports. The tertiary air jet is intended to \npenetrate the full cross-section of the unit through the \nmomentum of the upward moving gas stream from the \ncombustion in the hearth at the primary and secondary \nair levels. Like the secondary ports, the tertiary ports are \narranged in a horizontally interlaced pattern and have \nvelocity dampers to provide adjustment for optimum jet \npenetration. They usually operate at slightly higher static \npressure than secondary ports to achieve the necessary \nperformance. To maintain combustion in the proper loca­\ntion, the air flow splits and pressures must be effectively \nmaintained. Ranges of typical air flow distributions, inlet \ntemperatures and pressure differentials are summarized \nin Table 3.\nMultilevel tertiary air  In some cases, particularly \non existing units with tertiary ports already present, a \nfourth level of air is used to reduce NOx emissions. By \ndelaying the introduction of the final quantity of total air \nrequired for complete combustion, a significant reduction \nin NOx emissions can be achieved. The final level of air \nports may be as much as 25 ft (7.6 m) above the liquor \nspray nozzle elevation. Air ports for this fourth level are \ndesigned with similar criteria as tertiary ports, equipped \nwith velocity dampers, and arranged in an interlaced \npattern intended to penetrate the cross-section of the unit.\nOptimum NOx reduction does not require both a \ndedicated third and fourth level of air ports. The benefit \nof lower NOx emissions can also be achieved by utilizing \na single, final level of air ports (tertiary). Port elevation \nselection ultimately depends on accessibility, adequate \nfurnace height and clearance to the nose arch or screen, \nand the relative NOx reduction that is required.\nLiquor guns  Successful stationary or oscillating \nfiring depends on the correct liquor droplet size. This \nsize must permit complete in-flight drying before reach­\ning the bed. The variables in black liquor combustion \ninclude liquor percent solids, temperature and pressure \nat the spray nozzles, spray nozzle sizing and splash plate \nangle, and number and position of black liquor guns in \nservice. Other variables include the vertical and angular \nmovement of the oscillators or the off-horizontal angle of \nthe liquor guns for stationary firing. Other factors on the \nair side include total excess air, air temperature(s), air \nsplits between the primary, secondary and tertiary ports, \nand the static air pressure in each of these air zones.\nThe objective in the manipulation of all of these \nvariables is to control the steps of the drying and combus­\ntion of the liquor, and to control bed temperatures. A \ncomprehensive discussion of recovery boiler design and \nemissions is provided in Chapter 28.\nAuxiliary burners\nRecovery boilers are equipped with oil- and/or natural \ngas-fired auxiliary burners located at the secondary and \ntertiary air port elevations. The burners in the secondary \nwindboxes are used for unit startup, as black liquor can \nonly be fired into a heated furnace with an auxiliary \nignition source. The secondary burners are also used to \nstabilize the smelt flow and bed ignition during an upset \ncondition and to burn the bed out of the unit on shutdown. \nOperating problems\nTwo problems unique to recovery boiler operations are \nplugging and aggressive tube corrosion.\nPlugging of the superheater, boiler bank or economizer \nis generally caused by two mechanisms. The first is \ncondensation of the fume or normal gases given off by the \nblack liquor combustion. The hot combustion gases that \nleave the lower furnace contain vaporized compounds \nthat condense when the gas temperature is cooled in the \nupper zones of the boiler, superheater or boiler bank. This \ncondensation is dependent on gas temperature. The mate­\nrial condenses on the cooled heat transfer surfaces such \nas furnace screen tubes or primary superheater tubes. It \nalso precipitates out when the gas temperature falls below \napproximately 1100F (593C). In either case, this material \nis a source of fouling on convection surfaces. Condensation \nor precipitation depends upon the temperature regime and \nchemistry of the fume. The deposit can be in the plastic \nrange and very difficult to remove. On a properly designed \nand operated unit, this transition of the fume from a dry \ngas to a sticky substance takes place in the upper furnace, \nwide spaced screen or superheater. Here, the deposits \ncan be controlled by sootblowers. On an overloaded or \nimproperly operated unit, the gas temperature remains \n", "char_count": 5410, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_44", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Boiler Operations", "is_complete_section": true}}
