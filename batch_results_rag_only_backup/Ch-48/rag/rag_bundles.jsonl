For \neach 5.5 kg of UF6 at a natural circulation of 0.71% U-235, \nthe process produces 1 kg of UF6 enriched to 4.3% U-235 \nand 4.5 kg of UF6 depleted to 0.2% U-235.\nAlternatively, centrifuge technology has gained favor \nin a number of countries. In the centrifuge enrichment \nprocess, the gaseous UF6 is put into a cylindrical container \n(centrifuge) that spins the material at high speeds. The \nheavier U-238 atoms are flung to the outside of the \ncentrifuge leaving the UF6 in the center enriched with a \nhigher proportion of U-235. A single centrifuge will not \nachieve the necessary enrichment levels; therefore, it \nis necessary to connect a series of centrifuges together \nin a cascade. The enrichment is gradually increased to \nthe desired level in the 3 to 5 wt% range necessary for \ncurrently operating commercial nuclear power plants. The \ncentrifuge process requires only about 2% of the energy \nneeded for a gaseous diffusion plant to achieve the same \nlevel of enrichment.\nRecent efforts have focused upon the development \nof lasers for use in various enrichment processes. In \nthis process, requiring even less energy, photons are \nused to separate the desirable U-235 isotopes from the \nmore abundant but nonfissile U-238 isotopes found in \nnatural uranium. A full production facility has yet to \nbegin commercial operation in the U.S. Some concerns \nhave been raised with regard to nonproliferation and \nthe laser process, which has contributed to the delay of \ncommercialization.\nEnrichment services are sold in separative work \nunits (SWU). The SWU represents the energy required \nto separate U-235 and U-238. The uranium enrichment \nlevel depends on the amount of uranium feed, the amount \nof SWU used, and the desired U-235 concentration. If the \nprice of uranium is relatively low, then more uranium and \nless SWU will be used. Conversely, if the price of uranium \nis relatively high, then less uranium and more SWU will \nbe used to reach the desired U-235 concentration.\nFuel Fabrication\nNuclear fuel fabrication is the final step in producing \nuranium fuel for commercial light water nuclear power \nreactors. During fabrication, UF6 (typically enriched to \nbetween 3 and 5% U-235) is converted to UO2 powder. A \nceramic process is then used to convert the UO2 powder \nto pellets, which are mechanically loaded into metal rods. \nThe metal rods are then loaded into fuel assemblies, which \ntypically include Inconel® upper and lower end spacer grids, \nzircaloy-based intermediate spacer grids, and stainless \nsteel nozzles as shown in Fig. 4. Manufacturing these \ncomponents and integrating them into a fuel assembly \nrequire special methods and processes. Other combina­\ntions of Inconel and zircaloy-based grids may also be used.\nConversion to UO2 powder\nOnce enriched, UF6 is converted to UO2 for use in \nmaking the fuel pellets.

For the dry method, UF6 \nis heated to a vapor and fed into a two-stage rotary kiln \n(reaction vessel) where it is mixed with steam to generate \nsolid uranyl fluoride (UO2F2). This powder then moves \nthrough the vessel to react with hydrogen gas (H2), which \nremoves the fluoride. A chemical reduction takes the \nuranium to a pure microcrystalline uranium dioxide.\nWet processes inject UF6 into water to form a particu­\nlate slurry. Either ammonium carbonate [(NH4)2CO3] \nor ammonia (NH3) is added to this mixture to form \nammonium uranyl carbonate (AUC) or ammonium \ndiuranate (ADU). The slurry in each case is filtered, dried \nand heated to form pure UO2 in a reducing atmosphere. \nWet methods are more complex and produce more wastes.\nDownblending operations\nDownblending is the process whereby highly enriched \nuranium is processed to reduce its concentration of U-235 \nto levels suitable for use in commercial power plants. \nThe resulting low enriched uranium (LEU) is no longer \nsuitable for use in nuclear weapons and can be used for \npeaceful purposes. Megatons to Megawatts is a program \nthat has been in operation since 1995 in which the \nU.S. government and industry partners, including The \nBabcock & Wilcox Company (B&W), have downblended \nU.S. and Russian weapons-grade uranium to LEU. By \n2013 the equivalent of 20,000 nuclear warheads had been \ndownblended into commercial nuclear fuel. This fuel could \nproduce enough electricity to meet the demand for a city \nthe size of Boston for approximately 600 years.\nPellets\nThe UO2 powder is the primary constituent of nuclear \nfuel pellets. This powder is typically conditioned prior \nto pelletizing. Powders may require blending to ensure \nuniformity in terms of particle size and surface area. \nAlso, U3O8 may be added to ensure microstructure and \npellet density. Burnable absorbers (e.g., gadolinia or erbia) \nand pore-formers and binders may also need to be added.\nIn the pelletizing process, the enhanced UO2 powder \nis typically blended and sieved to form a homogeneous \nlot of about two tons. A pore-forming agent and recycled \nU3O8 are added to this blend. These materials are added \nin a ratio that attains the desired sintering density while \noptimizing pellet microstructure.\nAfter blending, the powder is fed into dies and \npressed biaxially into cylindrical pellet form. Pressing \nis performed using a reciprocating hydraulic or rotary \nunit. The press tonnage is set to provide a green (not yet \nsintered) pellet with high mechanical strength.\nThe next step, sintering, involves heating the pressed \npellets in a furnace with a dry hydrogen atmosphere. The \nthermal cycle includes a sintering period of approximately \n4.5 hours at 3180F (1749C). The pellets are then centerless \nground to their final dimensions. The final step is a visual \ninspection of the fuel pellets for any indication of cracks or \nsurface irregularities. Scrap from this step is fed back into \nan earlier stage of the process. The resulting fuel pellets \nare shown in Fig. 5. Selected thermophysical properties \nof the final fuel pellets are summarized in Table 2.\nAs an alternative to mixing gadolinia or erbia into the \nuranium oxide material, a boron coating can be added to \nthe outer surface of the pellet as a poison for reactivity \ncontrol. Most pressurized water reactor (PWR) fuel now \nmade in the U.S. uses boron-coated pellets.\nCladding\nZirconium forms the basis for commercial nuclear fuel \nrods. Zirconium-based alloys with improved corrosion \nperformance allow for higher discharge burnups and are \nin widespread use in the U.S. and Europe. To create the \nfuel rod, the qualified material is first reduced in cold \npilger (tube drawing) mills. An initial breakdown pass \nis performed to produce tubing near the required size. \nThis is followed by a second and third pass to achieve the \ntarget dimensions. After each pass, the tubing is rinsed \nand dried.\nThe cladding is then heat treated in a high vacuum \noven, which keeps the temperature uniform along the \ntube length. Subsequently, the material is cut to length. \nThe outer surfaces are given a final polish and the tubes \nare rinsed. A final inspection is then performed. This \nincludes an ultrasonic inspection to verify dimensions and \nto check for internal defects, and a visual examination \nwith backlighting to identify surface irregularities. \nFig. 5  Nuclear fuel pellets.\n", "char_count": 4491, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_003", "section_id": "chapter_4", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Fuel Fabrication", "is_complete_section": true}}

The serial number is verified at every step of the \nfuel rod fabrication process.

Each grid \nis numbered and traceability information is recorded. \nAfter assembly, the grid is laser welded at each strip \nintersection. Inconel and zircaloy grids are laser welded \nin an inert atmosphere.\nInspection personnel visually examine the more than \n500 welds of each grid. Cell dimensions are checked by an \nautomatic measuring system. (See Fig. 7.) Quality data \nis traceable back to the grid serial number.\nThe grids are installed into fixtures that secure them \nin the proper location. Next, control rod guide tubes are \ninserted through the grids. The grids are then secured \nto the guide tubes by resistance welding. The guide tubes \nand grids form the structural cage of the fuel assembly. \nThe fuel rods are then inserted into the grids.

As operating experience has been gained and \nboth industry- and government-sponsored test programs \nhave confirmed the higher burnup capability of the \nexisting and upgraded designs, the trend has shifted to \n18- or 24-month refueling cycles. Although fuel costs are \nhigher, the longer refueling cycle is cost effective due to \nreductions in the number of refueling outages, licensing \nsubmittals and replacement power cost. Furthermore, \nthe increased burnup capability of the fuel has permitted \nsubsequent batch size reductions with longer cycle times. \nToday, units on 18-month cycles are loaded with batch \nsizes once used for annual cycles. In addition to adopting \n18- or 24-month cycles, most [PWR and boiling water \nreactor (BWR)] plants have converted from the out/in \nshuffle scheme to a checkerboard scheme, which spreads \nthe fresh fuel homogenously throughout the core, because \nof its flexibility in accommodating the batch size and \nenrichment changes. Fresh fuel assemblies are also no \nlonger placed in core periphery positions in order to lower \nthe neutron fluence and protect the reactor vessel from \nits harmful effects.\nThe mPower SMR is designed to have up to a four-year \nfuel cycle. Upon completion of a four-year operating cycle, \nthe entire fuel load would be replaced. The increased plant \navailability and resulting capacity factor have shown to \nbe more beneficial than a shorter operating cycle, where \nfuel bundle shuffling would be utilized.\nAs nuclear fuel is consumed, its characteristics change. \nFour major issues are burnup dependent: dimensional \nand structural changes, cladding water-side corrosion \nand hydriding, fission gas release, and pellet cladding \ninteraction. Ongoing performance monitoring programs \nhave collected data to assess these phenomena. To date, \nassembly burnups of greater than 70,000 MWd/tmU have \nbeen attained.\nDimensional and structural changes\nDimensional and structural changes primarily include \nirradiation growth of the fuel rods and fuel assembly, hold-\ndown spring relaxation and fuel rod bow. Fuel assembly \ngrowth is caused by irradiation-induced growth of the \nguide tubes in the assembly and the stresses induced in \nthe guide tubes through the interaction with fuel rods \nand grids. Fuel rod growth has been comparable to fuel \nassembly growth because the fuel rod and assembly guide \ntubes are made of similar materials, and pellet-cladding \ninteraction (PCI) within the fuel rods has not shown any \ntendency to cause mechanically induced growth in the \nfuel rods.\nOther dimensional and structural changes, including \nchanges in the fuel rod diameter and fuel density, can occur \nin the fuel assembly and its components with continued \nirradiation. Although the database on these phenomena \nindicates no life-limiting constraints, the phenomena can \nhave combined effects on overall rod performance and \nsusceptibility to other failure mechanisms.\nCladding water-side corrosion and hydriding\nUnder reactor operating conditions, the fuel rod clad­\nding acquires a thin, adherent oxide layer early in life. \nAfter this initial film is established, the extent of further \nwater-side corrosion is a complex function of in-reactor \nresidence time, neutron fluence, local flow conditions, \nand coolant temperature and water chemistry.

The relatively low cost of nuclear fuel per \nunit of energy is one of the primary reasons that utilities \nwill opt to use nuclear power rather than fossil fuels for \nelectricity generation. Nuclear fuel is a compact source \nof energy, producing negligible adverse environmental \neffects and small amounts of residual waste products. \nIn some countries spent nuclear fuel is reprocessed to \nreclaim the uranium and plutonium in the discharged fuel \nassemblies. By reprocessing, about 97% of the materials \nin the spent fuel assembly can be reused.\nThe use of uranium as an energy source for steam and \npower generation involves a number of steps collectively \nreferred to as the nuclear fuel cycle. These steps include \nmining and milling, conversion, enrichment, pelletizing, \nencapsulation in zirconium alloy fuel rods, assembly \ninto fuel bundles, power production, and disposal. If \nthe spent fuel is not reprocessed, the cycle is referred \nto as a once-through or open fuel cycle. When the fuel is \nreprocessed, it goes through a closed fuel cycle. Fig. 1 \nprovides an overview of the closed nuclear fuel cycle from \nthe mining of the uranium ore to disposal. An open fuel \ncycle is currently the method utilized in the United States \n(U.S.). Fuel is stored in cooling pools until such time that \nit can be safely stored on site in dry casks. Chapter 53 \naddresses the important issue of disposal in more depth.\nNuclear Reactor Fuel Sources\nUranium\nUranium (U) is the basic raw material of the nuclear \npower industry. It is a heavy, slightly radioactive element \nwith an atomic number of 92. Uranium is the heaviest \nelement that is found naturally in more than trace \nquantities in the earth’s crust.\nUranium ore deposits are located throughout the world \nand are dominated by Kazakhstan, Canada, Australia, \nNiger and Namibia. (See Table 1.) Russia, South Africa, \nBrazil and the U.S. also have substantial uranium ore \ndeposits and production capabilities. The current reason­\nably assured resources (known deposits of such a size, \ngrade and configuration that they are recoverable with \nproven technology at costs of U.S. $130/kg U or less) are \napproximately 5,400,000 tonnes U. These deposits have \na high probability of commercial recovery.\nUranium is a highly reactive metal with three principal \nvalences: +3, +4 and +6. It has three crystalline phases \nand melts at 2070F (1132C). In the alpha (a) phase, it is \nChapter 48\nNuclear Fuels\nreasonably ductile and can be fabricated by standard met­\nalworking techniques. Because small uranium particles \nor chips are highly pyrophoric (capable of spontaneous \ncombustion when exposed to air), machining operations \nand scrap storage require special precautions, such as \nthe use of a coolant or an inert atmosphere.\nIsotopes and the fundamentals of nuclear physics are \ndiscussed in Chapter 49. Natural uranium is a mixture of \nthree isotopes: uranium-234 (U-234) 0.01%, uranium-235 \n(U-235) 0.71%, and uranium-238 (U-238) 99.28%. U-234 \nis present in small amounts and is not significant. U-235 \nis a fissionable isotope and U-238 is known as a fertile \nisotope which can be transmuted to a fissionable material.\nThese isotopes are slightly radioactive and emit alpha \nparticles. Because natural uranium has a relatively long \nhalf-life, a minimum of precaution is required when \nhandling it. However, it is chemically toxic and must not \nbe ingested. In handling areas, levels of airborne uranium \nmust be minimized.\nU-235 is fissionable because its nucleus can absorb a \nneutron, become unstable and split into multiple pieces. \nWhen 1 gram of U-235 fissions, the heat released is \nequivalent to approximately 1 MWd [24,000 kWh (82 × \n106 Btu)]. When one short ton of U-235 fissions, the heat \nreleased is equivalent to 22 × 109 kWh or 75 × 1012 Btu, \nwhich equals the energy contained in approximately 3 \nmillion tons of coal.\nBy itself, U-238 cannot sustain a nuclear chain \nreaction, but absorption of a high energy neutron can \ncause it to fission. Sufficient U-235 must be present to \ninitiate the fission process and drive the chain reaction. \nWhen exposed to neutrons in a nuclear reactor, the \nU-238 nucleus will capture a neutron and is transformed \ninto plutonium-239 (Pu-239), a fissile isotope. Pu-239 \nis capable of sustaining a chain reaction of fissions as \nthis process produces a similar number of free neutrons \nas U-235. U-238 is therefore considered to be fertile \nbecause of this transmutable property. U-238 is 140 times \nmore abundant in nature than U-235 and is the main \ncomponent of nuclear fuel.\nPlutonium\nAlthough trace quantities of plutonium are found \nin nature, most plutonium is made from U-238 trans­\nmutation.

At greater \ndepths, underground mining methods are employed. \nSome locations allow uranium to be dissolved by pumping \nsolutions underground, transporting it above ground, and \nthen extracting the dissolved uranium.\nA number of steps are required to extract uranium \nconcentrate from the ore and to prepare the uranium for \nuse in fabricating fuel pellets for commercial reactors. As \nshown in Fig. 1, these initial steps in the fuel cycle include \nmilling, conversion to uranium hexafluoride (UF6), \nenrichment, and conversion to uranium dioxide (UO2).\nMilling\nThe function of uranium milling is to extract the \nuranium from the ore, which contains on the average \nabout 5 lb (2.3 kg) of uranium per ton or about 0.25%. \nThe ore is crushed and is then leached with an acid or \nalkaline reagent to dissolve the uranium which, in turn, \nis recovered from the solution by solvent extraction or ion \nexchange techniques. Excess water is removed by calcin­\ning, or roasting. The resultant product, known in the \nindustry as yellowcake, is a crude uranium concentrate \ncontaining from 70 to 90% U3O8.\nConversion to UF6\nFor the purpose of enrichment, the uranium in yel­\nlowcake must be converted into UF6. Fig. 2 illustrates \nthe process, in which the essential steps are:\n1.\t The U3O8 feed is reduced to raw UO2 at 550 to 650C \nwith hydrogen or dissociated ammonia in the first \nconverter.\n2.\t The raw UO2 is converted to UF4 at 450 to 650C with \nanhydrous hydrogen fluoride (HF) gas in the second \nconverter.\n3.\t The UF4 is converted to crude UF6 at 350 to 500C with \nelemental fluorine in the last converter.\nThe final step is fractional distillation for the removal \nof impurities, principally molybdenum and vanadium. \nThe UF6 product meets the applicable specifications for \nimpurities allowable in uranium hexafluoride delivered \nfor enrichment in the separation plants.\nEnrichment\nPrior to fabrication into fuel assemblies, the uranium \nmust be enriched to the desired concentration of the fis­\nsionable isotope, U-235. This is accomplished in gaseous \ndiffusion plants which are designed to separate isotopes \nby using the principles of gas kinetics, or by using fast \nspinning cylinders in a centrifuge process.\nIn a mixture of two gases (U-238 and U-235 hexafluo­\nride), molecules of the lighter gas (235UF6) travel faster and \nstrike the walls of the containing vessels more frequently \nthan do the molecules of the heavier gas (238UF6). If the \nwall of the vessel is permeable, the lighter molecules will \ndiffuse faster, relative to their concentration, than the \nheavier molecules. The degree of separation attainable \nin this manner is very small and the process must be \nrepeated many times before a practical enrichment can be \nobtained. Therefore, a gaseous diffusion plant consists of \nhundreds of stages connected in series in an arrangement \nknown as a diffusion cascade.\nEach diffusion stage consists of a chamber divided \ninto two zones by a finely porous, thin barrier. The gas \nmixture enters one zone, which is maintained at a higher \npressure than the other. Conditions are adjusted so that \npart of the gas diffuses through the barrier into the lower \npressure zone and then is directed to the next stage up \nthe cascade. The remainder flows from the high pressure \nzone to the next stage down the cascade. The uranium \nhexafluoride gas stream diffusing through the barrier \nis very slightly enriched in the U-235 isotope; the other \nstream is very slightly depleted in that isotope.\nFig. 3 illustrates the sequence of operations in the \ncascade. Stages are arranged in a countercurrent \ncascade similar to a distillation column. At each stage, \na pump compresses the gas from the pressure on the \ndownstream side of the diffusion barrier to the pressure \non the upstream side and a cooler removes the heat of \ncompression.\nThe natural uranium feed enters the cascade at \nan intermediate point. The gas becomes increasingly \nenriched as it progresses up the cascade. The enriched \nuranium product is withdrawn at some stage above the \nfeed point, depending on the degree of enrichment desired. \nDepleted uranium (known as tails) is withdrawn from \nthe base of the cascade and held in storage.\n", "char_count": 5267, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_002", "section_id": "chapter_3", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Uranium Extraction, Enrichment", "is_complete_section": true}}
