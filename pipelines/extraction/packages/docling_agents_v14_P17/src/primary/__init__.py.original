"""
DoclingFirstAgent - V9 Docling-Based Document Extraction Agent

This agent represents a new approach to document processing that leverages 
Docling's superior structure-aware text extraction as the foundation for 
reliable table and content detection.

Key Innovation:
- Uses Docling's clean structured text instead of spatial coordinate analysis
- Page-based chunking for memory efficiency and error isolation  
- Structure-first approach rather than coordinate reconstruction
- Designed to solve the 100% false positive rate of spatial analysis
