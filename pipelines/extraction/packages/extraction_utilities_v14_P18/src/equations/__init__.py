# Note: Module files have v13 import style that needs migration
# These can be run standalone once imports are updated:
#   - analyze_extracted_text.py (has missing simple_equation_extractor dependency)
#   - equation_number_ocr_agent.py (imports available)
#   - equation_refinement_agent.py (has old 'from src.infra' imports)

# TODO: Update these files to use v14 package imports
