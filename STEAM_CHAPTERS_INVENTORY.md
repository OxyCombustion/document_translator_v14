## Top 5 Recommended for Initial Testing

1. **Ch-53: Nuclear Waste Management (0.4M)**
   - Path: `/home/thermodynamics/windows_zotero/storage/UNMJIZT3/Ch-53 Nuclear Waste Management.pdf`
   - Smallest chapter - ideal for pipeline validation

2. **Ch-44: Boiler Operations (1.0M)**
   - Path: `/home/thermodynamics/windows_zotero/storage/CZ5R6KY4/Ch-44 Boiler Operations.pdf`
   - Quick turnaround for testing

3. **Ch-48: Nuclear Fuels (1.1M)**
   - Path: `/home/thermodynamics/windows_zotero/storage/62IBFRKL/Ch-48 Nuclear Fuels.pdf`
   - Nuclear topic - different content type

4. **Ch-49: Principles of Nuclear Reactions (1.1M)**
   - Path: `/home/thermodynamics/windows_zotero/storage/B3STPXVQ/Ch-49 Principles of Nuclear Reactions.pdf`
   - Nuclear topic - likely equation-heavy

5. **Ch-08: Structural (1.2M)**
   - Path: `/home/thermodynamics/windows_zotero/storage/8ZZ2YGRA/Ch-08 Structural.pdf`
   - Engineering topic - good test case

## Technical Notes

### Duplicate Detection
- All chapters appear to have 2 copies in Zotero storage
- Different storage paths but identical file sizes
- This is normal Zotero behavior (sync + local storage)
- Inventory shows unique chapters only (one path per chapter)

### File Path Pattern
```
/home/thermodynamics/windows_zotero/storage/{HASH}/Ch-{NN} {Title}.pdf
```

Example:
```
/home/thermodynamics/windows_zotero/storage/UNMJIZT3/Ch-53 Nuclear Waste Management.pdf
```

### Processing Recommendations

1. **Start Small**: Begin with Batch 1 (micro chapters) to validate pipeline
2. **Monitor Performance**: Track processing time, memory usage, and error rates
3. **Incremental Testing**: Don't jump from 1M to 7M - gradually increase size
4. **Save Largest for Last**: Ch-09 and Ch-10 should be final validation
5. **Parallelize Wisely**: Small chapters can be batched, large ones process individually

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Inventory complete
2. ⏭️ Select first test chapter (recommend Ch-53)
3. ⏭️ Run extraction pipeline
4. ⏭️ Validate output quality
5. ⏭️ Proceed to Batch 1

### Quality Gates
Before processing next batch, verify:
- [ ] Extraction success rate > 95%
- [ ] No pipeline crashes or timeouts
- [ ] Output structure validated
- [ ] Memory usage acceptable
- [ ] Processing time reasonable
