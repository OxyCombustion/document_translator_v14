This life management activity must achieve \ncontinued high reliability and high availability for the \nentire life of the plant.\nMany of the plants reaching the end of their original \nexpected life implement, or at least consider, a variety of \nlife extension programs, depending on the license options. \nIn a power uprate program, components are methodically \nupgraded or replaced, and often plant subsystems are \nupgraded to increase the overall plant output. Operating \nlicense renewals and extensions are usually involved.\nPower uprate programs take many forms, but in the \nUnited States (U.S.), are based on regulatory-approved \nincreases in allowable maximum reactor core heat \noutput. Some utilities have refueled the reactor with \neither slightly more enriched fuel, or have used a higher \npercentage of new fuel in a refueling outage. Existing \nsystems must be able to withstand the higher power level \nconditions, while others are either modified or replaced.\nAlso in the U.S., measurement uncertainty recapture \n(MUR) uprates representing less than two percent of \nthe licensed power level employ more precise measure­\nment instruments and methods to increase the power \nlevel accuracy used by analysts. Stretch power uprates \n(SPUs) are normally between two and seven percent \nof the existing licensed power level, based on existing \noperating margins within the plant equipment. SPUs \ntypically involve changes to instrument settings and often \nupgrading of minor plant components. Extended power \nuprates (EPUs) are higher than stretch power uprates \nand have been approved as high as 20% of the licensed \npower level. EPUs have included significant upgrades or \nreplacements of equipment such as turbines, condensers, \npumps and motors, generators and transformers, as well \nas other systems and components. The review of these \nuprates by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) \ntypically focuses on several areas including the steam \nsupply system, instrumentation and controls, electrical \nsystems, accident evaluations, operations, and radiologi­\ncal and technical specification impacts.\nBecause most routine nuclear plant maintenance is \ndone during scheduled refueling outages and because of \nthe extended time between such outages (18 to 24 months), \nsuccessful long range outage planning is essential. \nUltimately, all of this planning effort is designed to obtain \napproval from the appropriate regulating authority to \nreturn the plant to full operation.\nChapter 52\nNuclear Services, Life Extensions\nand Enhancements\nIn some areas, the routine maintenance for nuclear \nplants is similar to that for fossil-fueled plants. This \nincludes the turbine-generator systems, pumps, valves, \nfans, filters, electrical distribution systems, and some \nof the instrumentation and control systems. Nuclear \nplants, however, have many inspection and maintenance \nactivities that are different in nature, precision, extent or \navailable access time. Also, in parts of the plant subject \nto radiation exposure, there are significant differences \ndue to radiological considerations. Dealing with the \nradiological issues imposes unique requirements on \nplant maintenance, especially in personnel protection, \nhandling of radioactive materials, personnel dose rate \nmonitoring, equipment and personnel planning and \nscheduling, disposal of waste items, and the need for \nremote robotic equipment.\nThe following sections focus on maintenance of the \nmajor components and the unique aspects of working in a \nnuclear facility. Most of the discussion is centered on the \nkey areas of the reactor primary heat transport system \nas shown in Fig. 1. The reactor shown has once-through \nsteam generators (OTSGs). Recirculating steam genera­\ntors (RSGs) have similar tubing inspection and repair \nrequirements but also have the steam drum/upper bundle \narea which requires periodic inspection.\nMaintenance – Key Issues\nPersonnel protection\nAlthough stringent precautions are taken, most \nnuclear plant maintenance and service workers are \nexposed to low levels of radiation. In the U.S., allowable \ntechnician dose limits are regulated by the NRC. Other \ncountries (e.g., Canada) set their own allowable personnel \ndose limits. Some operating companies curtail exposure \neven further, and individual long-term exposure is \nprecisely monitored throughout the industry.\nWorkers entering a radiologically controlled area \n(RCA) must wear protective clothing appropriate for \nthe levels of contamination encountered. This typically \nconsists of special paper coveralls, paper and rubber \nshoe covers, cotton liners and rubber gloves, and a paper \nhood or cap. Multiple layers of protective clothing are \nsometimes required, as are plastic suits if exposure to \nwater or wetted surfaces is anticipated. Respiratory \nprotection and/or plastic suits with supplied air may \nalso be required for highly contaminated or airborne \ncontamination environments.\n", "char_count": 5216, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_52", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Nuclear Services, Life Extensions", "is_complete_section": true}}
{"chunk_id": "unit_001_page_002", "page_number": 2, "text": "52-2\nSteam 42 / Nuclear Services, Life Extensions and Enhancements\nThe Babcock & Wilcox Company\nRadiation detection and monitoring\nIonizing radiation is not detectable by any of the \nhuman senses. Therefore, instruments such as the \npersonal electronic dosimeter (ED), handheld survey \nmeter, radiation isotope identification device (RIID) and \nradiation portal monitor, among others, are used to detect \nand verify accumulated dose, dose rates, and contamina­\ntion levels. Time of exposure is carefully monitored and \ncontrolled. The biological effects of radiation are discussed \nin Chapter 49. \nIn general, three types of checks are required as follows:\n1.\t Measurement of alpha (a), beta (b) and gamma (g) \nradiation by instruments such as the Geiger counter or \nionization chamber provide instantaneous indications \nof the total level of a, b and g radiation present. Instru­\nments display a dose rate or surface contamination \nlevel; for dose rates, units are typically expressed in \nRoentgens or Sieverts. All persons in areas where \nradiation may be encountered normally wear a film \nbadge or a thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD). These \ndevices are used for official records of current and \nextended exposure. They measure the amount of a, \nb and g radiation a person absorbs in terms of total \ndose for a day, week or month.\n2.\t Protection against neutrons is primarily provided \nby the concrete and water shielding around nuclear \nreactors and fuel storage pools. When a reactor first \ngoes into service, neutron counters as well as gamma \ncounters are used to carefully survey the surrounding \narea. Should leakage exist, the shielding is modified. \nThereafter, periodic checks are made for gamma \nand neutron leakage. In experimental installations, \nor where neutron surveys indicate the need for \ncontinuous surveillance, special film badges and \nneutron dosimeters may also be used.\n3.\t Keeping the concentration of alpha emitters in working \nspaces and in outgoing air below prescribed tolerances \nis sufficient to protect against a particles. Alpha \ncounters monitor air quality in working spaces on a \nregular schedule. Samples of dust accumulating in \nvarious areas of a room are monitored periodically \nfor alpha radiation. The air concentrations are then \nconverted into internal exposures for the worker. \nWhole body counters and urinalysis can also help \nensure that the workers’ internal exposures are well \nwithin the regulatory limits. Portable alpha friskers \nare also used to monitor hands, shoes and clothing of \npersonnel leaving risk areas.\nWhen high radioactive air concentrations occur, other \nprecautions, such as respirators, self-contained breathing \nair and glove boxes, or other engineering controls, are \nused to protect the workers from internal exposures.\nLimited accessibility\nA major constraint to performing nuclear plant \nmaintenance is the limited accessibility of much of the \nequipment. The primary reactor system is not accessible \nduring power operation. As a result, this equipment must \nbe serviced only during periodic, scheduled outages. Most \noutages are scheduled far in advance for reactor refueling \nand other outage activities. Repair, replacement or return \nto service of parts must be based upon maintaining fitness \nfor service to the next point in time when that part will \nbe available for inspection or replacement.\nPlant equipment is required by license to be operable \nduring normal operation. If a safety-related system fails, \nthe operator typically has some limited period of time \nfor its repair and return to service, otherwise the entire \nreactor unit must be shut down. Examples of such critical \nequipment include the high pressure injection system, low \npressure/decay heat removal system, core flood system, \nbuilding spray system, reactor protection system, and \nnuclear instrumentation systems. The term safety-related \ntypically applies to any and all components, systems and \neven written procedures that ensure regulatory-approved \noperation, including shutting down a plant and maintain­\ning a plant in a safe, post-shutdown condition.\nForeign material exclusion (FME)\nWhen any system is opened there is a possibility for \nentrance of foreign materials. Safeguards therefore be­\ncome a critical element of any service project. Site-specific \nforeign material exclusion programs and procedures are \nheld by owners, operators and service contractors. These \nprograms define boundary barriers and access restric­\ntions, system logs and access monitoring, as-found and \nas-left inspections, and general housekeeping procedures \nincluding personnel training.\nTypical foreign materials include hand tools, loose \nparts, metal shavings, adhesives, lanyards and tethers, \nand paper, among others. Retrieval methods range from \nhand retrieval to robotics. All retrieval activities are \nplanned, documented and reported. In addition, FME \ncovers are regularly installed wherever possible to \nprevent entrance of foreign materials.\nApplication of remote technology\nThe principles of time, distance and shielding are \napplied to limit personnel and overall radiation exposure \nwhen performing nuclear plant maintenance. Time of \nexposure is minimized to the extent practical, distance \nbetween personnel and source(s) of radiation is maxi­\nmized, and shielding materials are used where possible \nto reduce radiation levels. These principles embody the \nphilosophy of ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) \nwhich entails making every reasonable effort to minimize \nexposure to ionizing radiation, commensurate with \navailable technology and economic and societal factors.\nAdvances in technology, particularly in the area of \nrobotics, have led to reduced radiation exposure, reduced \nschedule durations, and higher quality inspection and \nrepair activities in many areas of nuclear plant main­\ntenance. When considering whether remote technology \nis applicable, the component and area radiation levels, \nthe time required to perform the maintenance activity, \nand the working environment are evaluated. Key areas \nwhere remote or robotic technology has been applied \ninclude work in or around the reactor vessel and its \ninternals, and within the steam generators and other \nplant heat exchangers. Because the reactor vessel is \nhighly radioactive, it is submerged under water during \nmaintenance and refueling. Although the water shields \nthe workers from radiation, remote and/or fully robotic \nequipment is necessary to perform refueling, inspections, \n", "char_count": 6527, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_52", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Nuclear Services, Life Extensions", "is_complete_section": true}}

The inspection of many \nthousands of steam generator tubes using multiple \ninspection techniques in a reduced outage duration is \nnot unusual. These advances in technology, as well as \nefforts to optimize other inspection and maintenance \nactivities and to shorten the refueling sequence, have led \nto shorter overall outages. As a result of these shorter, \nmore effective and efficient outages, the average U.S. \nreactor availability has increased in recent decades from \n60% to more than 95%.\nAlthough remote technology often encompasses the \nuse of robots, it can also be an extension of a hand tool \nor the development of a flexible probe and manipulator to \nincrease distance from the component, or to allow internal \naccess to tight or complicated spaces. Each maintenance \ntask requires a different degree of sophistication based on \nthe working environment and the complexity of the task. \nAs remote technology advances, the amount of personnel \nradiation exposure declines even as the scope, quality \nand precision of the work increase.\nIn the U.S., steam generator inspection equipment, \nprocedures and examination personnel must be in full \ncompliance with the Electric Power Research Institute \n(EPRI) Pressurized Water Reactor Steam Generator \nExamination Guidelines, American Society of Mechanical \nEngineers (ASME) Code, and other applicable standards \nand regulations.\nALARA Considerations and Training\nEach activity conducted in a radiologically controlled \narea is clearly planned, identified and controlled through \nthe use of procedures, work packages and a radiation \nwork permit (RWP), which establishes ALARA and other \nradiological controls to be applied to the activity.\nTo support task efficiency and to promote the ALARA \nconcept during nuclear plant maintenance, preliminary \nmockup training is often performed using the actual \ninspection and repair equipment, applied to realistic \nmockups of the plant components, prior to performance \nin the field. (See Fig. 2.) The level of mockup training \nperformed is typically proportional to the scope and \ncomplexity of the project or activity, and to the radiological \nsignificance of the activity in terms of individual and col­\nlective dose. This may entail extended periods of training \nin an environment designed to closely simulate actual \nconditions within the nuclear plant, including the use \nof protective clothing and other expected conditions and \ncontrols. The goal is to reduce exposure time and to clearly \nrecognize and prepare for both expected and unexpected \nconditions which might arise in the actual performance of \nthe work. Mockup training and simulations often result \nin additional efficiencies or enhancements to the process \nand/or tooling.\nSafety conscious work environment \nAlthough often used interchangeably with the term \nSafety Culture, or having a safety-first focus, Safety \nConscious Work Environment (SCWE) promotes a will­\ningness to express safety concerns as part of that safety \nculture. In 2003, the U.S. NRC issued a policy statement, \napplicable to all NRC licensees and their contractors, to \nestablish and maintain such a Safety Conscious Work \nEnvironment. Simplified, the SCWE process encourages \naffected employees to raise any and all safety, quality or \nregulation compliance issues with their own management \nor with the NRC, without fear of retaliation. The process \nincludes prompt review, resolution and feedback to those \nraising the concerns.\nThe policy statement outlines and explains three \nprincipal areas of focus and action: 1) ensure that ef­\nfective licensee processes for problem identification and \nresolution exist, 2) improve contractor awareness of their \naffected responsibilities, and 3) involve licensee senior \nmanagement in any employment actions which could be \nmotivated by discrimination or recrimination.\nWhen implemented, the regulatory issue applies \nto all U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensees, \napplicants for licenses, holders of certificates of compli­\nance, and all contractors and subcontractors subject \nto NRC authority. All NRC licensees and contractors \nare expected, although not required by regulation, to \nestablish this environment.\nComponent Maintenance\nPlant life management\nThe objective of plant life management, including life \nextension, is to ensure that the plant equipment achieves \na continuing state of high availability throughout its \noperating life. Life management places emphasis on the \nassessment of component condition prior to scheduled \noutages and on the scheduling, planning and mobilization \nof workforce, equipment and methodology to achieve \ntimely execution of the outage work. Outages may only end \nwhen all work is successfully completed and documented, \nand approval is granted by the appropriate regulatory \nauthority for the reactor unit to return to service.\nBecause experience has shown that much of the plant \navailability is dependent on the successful operation of the \nsteam generators, the discussion and illustration of plant life \nmanagement methods will concentrate on these components.\nFig. 2  Mockup training prior to field activity.\n", "char_count": 5528, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_52", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Nuclear Services, Life Extensions", "is_complete_section": true}}

This life assess­\nment is necessary to establish the operating history \nof the component and to provide a basis for planning a \nmulti-outage inspection and maintenance program. For \nsteam generators, the life assessment and other work \nshould individually address the three major areas of: 1) \npressure vessel boundary, 2) the heat transfer tubing, and \n3) internals such as tube supports, steam separators and \nfeedwater headers. Breakdown into these three areas is \nnecessary because the regulatory requirements and the \ninspection and maintenance requirements for each are \nunique.\nPressure vessel boundary  The design, manufacture, \nin-service inspection and repair of all component pressure \nvessel boundaries are regulated by the ASME Boiler and \nPressure Vessel Code as augmented by other regulatory \nrequirements. During manufacture, the Code-defined \nvolumetric inspections ensure the components meet \nstringent standards and establish a baseline for in-service \nevaluations. In-service requirements specify examination \nof the pressure vessel boundary, including visual inspec­\ntion and volumetric nondestructive examination (NDE) \nof the welds. An assessment of the steam generator must \ndetermine the condition of the equipment and any areas of \nnoncompliance with the requirements, and must identify \nany work needed to restore the unit to a compliant state.\n Tubing  The steam generator tubing is the boundary \nbetween the primary and the secondary heat transport \nsystems and is very important to the integrity of the plant. \nTube integrity is the primary concern when reviewing \nthe steam generator. In plants designed by The Babcock \n& Wilcox Company (B&W), there are about 15,000 tubes \nin each of the two once-through steam generators. (See \nFig. 1.) In plants with recirculating steam generators, \nthere are about 3000 to 11,000 tubes in each of two to four \nsteam generators per plant. (See also Chapter 50.) With \na typical tube wall thickness of about 0.04 in. (1 mm) or \nless, the tubing is a vulnerable boundary and must be \ncarefully maintained and monitored. Tube leaks are a \nmajor concern and primary to secondary leakage above \ncertain prescribed limits requires shutdown of the plant.\nExperience has shown the tubing to be a major cause of \nloss of plant availability, extended outages, and expensive \nrepair and replacement work. Common problems with \nsteam generator tubing are generally related to corrosion \ninvolving a combination of materials and water chemistry \nissues. Some of the more common problems are stress cor­\nrosion cracking, pitting, wastage, erosion, fretting at tube \nsupports, and denting due to corrosion of carbon steel tube \nsupports. Fretting due to flow-induced vibration (FIV) \nand fretting due to foreign object ingress may also exist. \nIn modern replacement steam generators with highly \ncorrosion resistant tubing and improved tube support, \nforeign object damage may be the most serious concern \nregarding tube integrity. Because of the magnitude and \nfrequency of problems over the years, the tubing receives \nthe majority of attention in the life management plan.\nInternals  Internals common to all types of steam \ngenerators include tube supports, shrouds (bundle \nwrapper) and feedwater and/or auxiliary water headers. \nFor recirculating units, additional internals include \nU-bend tube supports, steam separators and various \nsupports and baffles internal to the steam drum (upper \nshell). In contrast to the tube bundle that contains many \nidentical elements (tubes), the internals consist of a large \nnumber of parts that are dissimilar in terms of function, \nconfiguration and accessibility for service. The internals \nare subject to a variety of flow forces and flow-induced \nvibrations. Bundle supports in close contact with the \ntubing can cause tube degradation due to fretting, and \ntube denting due to corrosion of the supports. The life \nassessment process must consider the potential for a wide \nvariety of problems with these internals.\nLife management program plan  Following the \nassessment of the component, a long range life manage­\nment plan can be developed. Table 1 illustrates a small \nportion of such a plan for a set of steam generators. It \nshows the scope, timing, inspection, cleaning and repair \nactivities for outages 11 through 14 of the total life cycle. \nA full nuclear plant or unit plan would cover many more \nrefueling outage cycles, more plant components, and \nmany more activities.\nHaving identified the necessary inspection and \nmaintenance tasks, significant effort is then required to \ndefine work scope, prepare detailed plans and procedures, \nand obtain all required licensee and regulatory approvals \nto proceed, all with an approved Nuclear Quality Assur­\nance Program.\nA typical outage would result in a large volume of tube \neddy current testing (ECT), pressure vessel inspections, \nand visual and foreign object search and retrieval \n(FOSAR) programs for the primary- and secondary-side \ninternals. There would also be cleaning activities, repairs, \nand possibly some component modifications that had \nbeen planned in advance. The assessment of this large \ndatabase of information, which is done as soon as the \ninspection data is available, forms the basis for the next \nphase to determine fitness for service.\nFitness-for-service assessment  The fitness-for-\nservice assessment is a methodology for determining \nthat a particular plant component is in an acceptable \ncondition at the time of inspection (referred to as condition \nmonitoring) and confirming that it will be in an accept­\nable condition at the time of its next planned inspection \n(operational assessment). The method is illustrated by \nFig. 3 which shows the current as-measured size of a \ndefect in a steam generator tube wall, the estimated \ngrowth for a period of operations, and the estimated size \nat the time of its next inspection. Essentially, the initial \nas-measured size from tube inspection, with an added \nallowance for measurement error, is plotted at the time \nof the current inspection. A projection is made of the \ngrowth of this defect to the time of the next inspection. \nIf the projected flaw size at the time of the next inspec­\ntion is greater than the allowable flaw size, the tube is \nconsidered potentially unsafe and is most likely removed \nfrom service by plugging.\nThe probability of detecting a particular defect in \ntubing is dependent on the nature of the defect (pitting, \nfretting, cracking, etc.) and its location relative to other \nsources of electronic signals such as tube supports, tube \nwall expansion transitions and corrosion deposits. With \ncurrent technology, pits measuring only a small percent­\nage of the wall thickness can be detected.

Also, \nallowance for measurement error is necessary to ensure \nthat a high percentage of the actual defect sizes are within \nthe bounds of these derived defect sizes.\nSteam generator primary-side maintenance\nMaintenance of a steam generator primary side \nincludes the major activities of: \n1.\t inspecting the tubes, \n2.\t plugging tubes that fail to meet the inspection criteria, \nand\n3.\t stabilizing out-of-service tubes to keep them from \ndamaging their neighbors.\nSteam generator tube inspection  Based on prior \nexperience with the steam generators under examination, \nsome fraction of the tubing will require inspection on a \nperiodic basis. For example, it may be determined that \nhalf of the steam generators in the plant will be inspected \nat every second outage (as in Table 1). There may also \nbe commitments for specialized inspections or for other \ntube inspections as a condition for a return-to-service \napproval from prior outages.\nEddy current testing (ECT)  Use of an integrated eddy \ncurrent inspection system is the primary inspection \nmethod, although ultrasonic testing (UT) is used in spe­\ncial cases. Specific procedures provide the requirements \nfor multifrequency and multiparameter eddy current \nexamination of nonferromagnetic steam generator tubing, \nas well as tube plugs and other tubular materials.\nThe ECT is conducted by imposing an alternating \ncurrent (AC) magnetic field. This field induces eddy \ncurrents in the material that create a secondary magnetic \nfield. If discontinuities are present, the eddy currents are \naltered and the apparent impedance of a detecting coil is \nchanged. The size of the discontinuity can then be related \nto this change by prior calibration.\nUsing bobbin, rotating pancake coil (RPC), and/or \narray probes, tubes are typically inspected by inserting \nthe probe and then inspecting the tube while withdrawing \nthe probe at a controlled rate.

OTSG \nand RSG tubes can be inspected full length from one \nplenum; some smaller radius RSG tubes may require \naccess from both ends to achieve a full length inspection. \nA typical robotic positioner for the ECT probes is shown \nin Fig. 4.\nSeveral different probes are used to characterize \nthe tubing condition. A bobbin coil ECT probe basically \nconsists of a bobbin wound with coils of wire. Eddy cur­\nrents generated by the coil electromagnetically couple the \nprobe and the test piece with the eddy currents flowing \nin a direction parallel to the coil winding. Eddy current \nsignals from a bobbin coil are measured as changes \nin primary coil electrical impedance induced by the \neddy current magnetic field. Bobbin coil ECT has been \nused throughout the industry for many years, although \nother probe types are essential to complement the basic \ninformation received. One limitation is that the signal is \nintegrated 360 degrees around the tube and is therefore \nunable to differentiate within that range. The bobbin coil \nis able to size many types of defects once the nature of \nsuch defects has been determined by laboratory analysis \nor by other probe types, but it is not good for exploring \nunknown situations such as detecting tight cracks of \nmoderate size or circumferentially oriented cracks. It can, \nhowever, be used to see further in the radial direction \nthan other ECT techniques. It is sensitive at low operating \nfrequencies to conditions (supports, deposits) beyond the \ntube outer surface; at high frequencies it has a shorter \nrange of vision.\nBecause of these limitations, a number of rotating and \narray probes have been developed. Motorized rotating \npancake coils (MRPC), +Point (plus point) rotating \nprobes and X-Probe array probes are examples. Rotating \nprobes like MRPC and +Point provide excellent and finely \ndetailed data but have the disadvantage of very slow probe \ntravel speed. The X-Probe offers the speed of the bobbin \nwith the detail of rotating probes, although with the \ngeneration of a very large amount of data. Fig. 5 shows a \ntypical arrangement of the bobbin coil and X-Probe; the \ndata acquisition and analysis system is shown in Fig. 6.\nScan mode for bobbin and array probes is a simple axial \ntraverse through the tube using a drive mechanism to \ncontrol the scan speed. Scan mode for a rotating probe is \nhelical scan using one drive mechanism to rotate or spin \nthe probe and another to traverse it through the tube at \na specific speed.\nUltrasonic testing (UT)  UT of tubing is a valuable \ntool, particularly in the early investigative phase where \na newly discovered condition must be characterized. \nThe process requires a rotating surface-riding UT probe \nwhere the signal path must be flooded by a couplant \nsuch as water. Because of the rotation and the couplant, \nthe process is slow and somewhat awkward, but it does \nhave excellent resolution. It has the advantage of seeing \nindications differently than ECT, thereby providing \nresults to supplement the ECT information.\nDestructive examination (DE)  DE is a vital part of \ninvestigating any newly discovered degradation condition \nin tubing (or in other component areas). Except perhaps for \nphenomena like fretting, it is not possible to characterize \na degradation condition and to determine its root cause \nwithout sample removal and laboratory examination. \nUntil newly discovered defects are characterized in the \nlab, it is not possible to know with any certainty the \nrelationship between the defect and the ECT signal it \nproduced in the field. Because some of the more critical \ndefects such as tight cracks are difficult to see at any time, \neven where they are relatively large, such characteriza­\ntion is vital.\nRemote technology  In the early years of nuclear \npower all of the maintenance work was performed \nmanually by technicians who entered the steam \ngenerator head. As maintenance activities and radiation \nlevels increased with plant aging, it became increasingly \ndifficult to perform repairs manually. As inspecting \never larger numbers of tubes during refueling outages \nbecame mandatory, this work was a logical candidate for \nearly remote technology.

For RSGs, an articulated arm manipulator \nwas used. Although also manually installed, it was not \ncomputer controlled. Both manipulators performed well \nfor inspection, but they could not support the heavy tools \nrequired for plugging and other repair operations. In \naddition, because of reduced radiation dose limits, the \npractice of manually installing the manipulators had to \nbe eliminated.\nAdvanced robotics  Steam generator inspection and \nrepair manipulators have been developed to minimize \nhuman exposure, to perform multiple inspection and \nrepair duties, and to be computer controlled. As technol­\nogy has continued to advance, manipulators have evolved \nfrom simpler designs requiring operator interaction and \nfeedback to systems representing true robots, largely \nfunctioning in an autonomous mode.\nAn earlier design of a remote manipulator is shown \nin Fig. 7.

The control center was located outside \nthe containment building.\nFig. 8 shows a present day steam generator robot. The \nZR-100 operates in a fully automatic mode, requiring \nlittle operator intervention. It is tubesheet mounted, \nthus it creates no exclusion zones which would delay \nthe inspection or repair process by requiring a platform \nevolution to reposition the robot. This robot is capable of \nsupporting ECT, plugging, stabilization, in situ pressure \ntesting, and other activities required on the primary side.\nTube plugging  Any tube not meeting the established \ncriteria for acceptability must be taken out of service or \nrepaired. While explosive plugs were used in the 1970s \nand 1980s, rolled mechanical plugs are now the standard.\nThe rolled mechanical plugs form the pressure bound­\nary at the tubesheet primary face between the primary \nand secondary sides when they are installed inside steam \ngenerator tubes being removed from service. The pressure \nboundary is formed when the plugs are mechanically roll \nexpanded against the surrounding tube and tubesheet \nusing an electrically driven tool head, thereby providing \na structural integrity pressure boundary between the \nprimary and secondary sides. The plugs are designed to \nremain in place during all operating conditions for the \nlife of the steam generators. Seal welded plugs are also \nused in some applications. Depending upon the quantity \nof welded plugs to be installed, the process may be manual \n(for one or two tubes) or automated, with the welding tool \nmounted to the steam generator robot.\nTube stabilization  Certain tubes removed from \nservice by plugging are also stabilized using a length of \nstainless steel wire rope, depending upon the location of \nFig. 6  Eddy current data acquisition and analysis system for multi-coil \narray probe.\nRemote\nData Acquisition\nUnit\nControl\nCable\nLAN\nRobotic\nManipulator\nController\nProbe\nPusher\nPower Supply\nRobotic\nManipulator\nControl Cable\nFixture\nControl\nWork\nStation\nPC\nSteam Generator\nPrimary Head\nProbe\nPusher\nPower and\nControl\nCables\nLAN\nRobotic Manipulator\nFig. 7  Tubesheet-mounted manipulator inside a recirculating steam \ngenerator primary head.\n", "char_count": 3586, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_52", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Nuclear Services, Life Extensions", "is_complete_section": true}}

The stabilizer protects the structural \nintegrity of the out-of-service tube by lending additional \nstiffness and by dampening motion due to flow-induced \nvibration. The stabilizer also prevents the out-of-service \ntube from damaging adjacent in-service tubes. Stabilizers \nare installed remotely using automated tooling and the \nsteam generator robot.\nIn situ pressure testing  In situ pressure testing \n(ISPT) equipment is used for proof and leak testing \nof in-service steam generator tubes. Proof tests are \ntypically conducted at three times the normal operating \ndifferential pressure. Leak tests are typically conducted \nat the limiting accident conditions, e.g., steam line break \nconditions. Correction factors are included in the test \npressure to account for temperature corrections and gauge \nuncertainty. The test pressure can also be adjusted to \nsimulate external loads.\nSteam generator secondary-side maintenance\nWhile control of secondary-side water chemistry helps \nto minimize repairs in this area, some inspection and \nmaintenance is necessary. Two conditions, fouling and \nsludge buildup, must be eliminated. Fouling consists of \ndeposition of solids, primarily iron, on the outside of tubes \nand at the tube support plates. Support plate deposits \ncan increase pressure drop resulting in reduced steam \ngenerator performance. Tube bundle deposits can reduce \nheat transfer capability and also degrade performance. \nMore important, buildup of these deposits can concentrate \ncontaminants such as chlorides and fluorides that \npromote stress corrosion cracking—a problem which has \ndestroyed tens of thousands of tubes and has led to the \nneed for extensive steam generator replacements.\nSludge buildup occurs at the lower tubesheet of the \nsteam generator where solids from the feedwater are \ndeposited. Again, other contaminants can concentrate in \nthis sludge, degrading the tubes. In some instances, the \nsludge changes from a soft slurry to a hard consistency, \nand can form hard collars around the tubing.\nDifferent techniques are used to remove these sludge \nbuildups. Chemical cleaning has been used for the tube \nsupport plates and tube bundle. A chemical solution is \nintroduced into the secondary side during a shutdown. \nThen, following a soaking period, the unit is flushed. \nSludge piles are removed by water lancing. This process, \nalso known as sludge lancing, uses high pressure water \nintroduced robotically through a secondary-side opening \nto loosen deposits. The loose deposits and water are \nthen suctioned out of the steam generator and processed \nthrough a filter system.\nFig. 9 shows a flexible inter-tube waterlance system \nused by B&W for steam generator cleaning. The system \nuses six or eight small-diameter pressure tubes to deliver \nhigh pressure water to the very small nozzles in its end \nmanifold. These end manifolds direct intense water jets \nat the tubesheet face and upward toward the lowermost \nsupport. The flexible lance is fed into the steam generator \nthrough a secondary-side inspection port just above the \ntubesheet. A semi-rigid guide directs the flexible lance \nalong the steam generator’s central tube-free lane, \nguides it through a tight right-angle turn, and projects \nit into the individual intertube lanes and ultimately to \nthe bundle periphery. The jet action dislodges the sludge \ndeposits from the tubesheet (and/or from tube supports) \nand permits the deposits to be flushed out of the bundle \nand removed by suctioning. This inter-tube system is \nparticularly effective for hard deposits. Fig. 10 shows the \nwater jet spraying from a flexible lance positioned within \na small demonstration tube bundle.\nOther sludge lancing systems spray water from the \nsteam generator no-tube lane or periphery through the \ntube bundle. These systems are used mainly for the \nremoval of soft sludge.\nThe need for chemical cleaning or sludge lancing \nFig. 9  Flexible inter-tube waterlance system – waterlance and drive \nunit mounted to a steam generator mockup.\nFig. 8  ZR-100 robot delivery platform.\n", "char_count": 4242, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_52", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Nuclear Services, Life Extensions", "is_complete_section": true}}

(See Fig. 11.) These inspections are used to \nfind and identify anomalies, loose parts or foreign mate­\nrial which may be present within the steam generator. \nLoose parts are often identified during eddy current \ntesting of the primary-side tubing. Removal of loose parts \nis desirable to prevent fretting or wear of the tubes which \nmay lead to removal from service.\nA wide range of inspection strips, cameras and \nremotely operated carts or crawlers are used for these \ninspections. Additionally, precision retrieval tooling, \nincluding grippers, snares and other instruments, can \nbe simultaneously employed to remove any objects dis­\ncovered during the inspection. The use of high definition \nand sub-miniature cameras is expanding the capability \nin this area, allowing visual inspections and retrievals \nfrom deep within the tube bundle.\nSteam generator replacements\nIn extreme cases, or for selected uprates and life exten­\nsion programs, steam generator replacements become \nthe best option. The following represents a typical steam \ngenerator and reactor vessel head replacement outage, \nusing a hypothetical B&W-designed pressurized water \nreactor (PWR) unit. Initial critical features are metrology \nand laser scanning, interference identification, temporary \nsupport and restraint requirements, scaffolding, rigging \nplan and path verifications, and polar crane inspection \nactivities.\nIn parallel with defueling, a temporary containment \nopening is begun from the outside of containment.

The new RVCH, if specified, is installed \nafter refueling is complete. After closure of containment, \nfinal system testing and the integrated leak rate test \nare completed, and the system is turned over for restart.\nThis takes place during an extended refueling outage, \ncarefully planned, with as much preliminary work \ncompleted as possible during previous outages. The list \nof significant related activities includes engineering \nand licensing support, procurement, equipment rigging \nand transport, radiation protection and health physics \nprograms, skills training and mockup support, and \nfull implementation of safety and quality assurance \nprograms. Temporary on-site facilities for component \nand equipment storage, office and other facilities outside \ncontainment, temporary containment access, temporary \ndecontamination systems, training and testing, personnel \nsupport, warehousing and parking are also normally \nrequired.\nReactor vessel and internals\nWhile the reactor vessel and its internals are static \nequipment, they are not free from either degradation or \nthe need for maintenance. Maintenance ranges from care \nfor the studs, gaskets and gasket surfaces during each \nrefueling outage to repairs for various severe and costly \ndegradation mechanisms.\nReactor vessel  The vessel closure is the large \ndiameter, high pressure bolted flange with its delicate \ngasket face which is the joint between vessel and head. \nDuring refueling, the reactor head must be removed from \nthe vessel to gain access to the core. Each of the very \nlarge studs that retain the head is also removed from \nthe vessel for cleaning. Special precautions are taken to \ncontain the contaminated particulate that is released by \nstud cleaning equipment. Following cleaning, each stud is \nlubricated for reinsertion into the vessel flange. Likewise, \neach stud hole is cleaned prior to retensioning the studs.\nThe primary seal between the reactor vessel flange \nand head is a double O-ring configuration. Both mating \nsurfaces must be thoroughly cleaned before installing \nthe O-rings, which are replaced each time the head is \nremoved. The seals are installed on the head and, just \nprior to setting the head, the vessel flange is cleaned and \ninspected for scratches that could cause leakage.\nReactor vessel heads worldwide have, of late, been \nsubject to extensive degradation and some leakage due \nto stress corrosion cracking of the weld joints between the \ncontrol rod drive mechanism (CRDM) guide tubes and \nthe head. These guide tubes penetrate the head and are \nwelded to the cladding at the inner surface of the head. \nIn at least one case, extensive corrosion of the head itself \nhad occurred before this problem was discovered.\nBecause these welds are difficult and costly to inspect \nand repair, many utilities have chosen to replace the \nheads with components made with new, more corrosion \nresistant materials.\nThe small instrument guide tubes in the lower head of \nthe reactor have also required attention at times but to a \nmuch lesser degree than the head penetrations.\nIn addition to these more conventional forms of \ndegradation, the effect of neutron radiation on reactor \nvessels must be considered. Neutrons can reduce the \ntoughness of steels, increasing their susceptibility to \nbrittle fracture. As a result, the welds in the reactor \ncore region are subjected to extensive UT examination. \nOf particular interest is the surface just under the clad­\nding. Special techniques are used to achieve maximum \ncoverage and sensitivity.\nTo gain access to the inside surface of the reactor \nvessel, all the fuel and internals must be removed. \nDue to its highly irradiated condition, the vessel must \nremain filled with water to provide shielding. Each weld, \nincluding those between the nozzles and primary piping, \nmust be examined. A typical vessel inspection can take \nfrom 10 to 20 days, depending on the quantity of welds \nand the need for rescanning.\nInternals  While the reactor vessel internals require \nlittle routine maintenance, there have been various core \nbarrel integrity problems, mostly related to vibration \ndue to inlet flow buffeting. Because the internals are \nhighly radioactive, any repairs must be done under water. \nThe bolted joints of the reactor internals have required \nthe most repair activity. Stress corrosion cracking of \nhigh strength steel or Inconel® bolts has been the most \ncommon cause for repair. Although the performance of \nA-286 stainless and X-750 Inconel bolts was expected to \nbe good, pure water stress corrosion has been a problem.\nIn replacing these bolts, standard wrenches, drills \nand sockets have been adapted to be operated from an \nextension or underwater platform. Underwater cameras \nfacilitate these remote repairs.\nControl rod drive mechanisms (CRDM)\nThe CRDMs are mounted to the top of the reactor \nvessel head and control the movement of the reactivity \ncontrol rods in the core. A central shaft known as either \na lead screw or drive shaft attaches to the control rod \nand is moved by the mechanism. The CRDM is powered \nelectrically, and position indication (PI) switches are used \nto let the reactor operator know the position of the control \nrod. During refueling outages, inspections, tests and \nroutine maintenance are performed on the mechanisms \nto assure the motors and PI systems are functioning \nproperly. Motors with unacceptable characteristics are \nreplaced. PI switches are also replaced if they are not \nfunctioning properly. Some CRDM designs attach to the \nreactor vessel head with bolts and use gaskets to provide \nthe sealing. Occasionally these joints leak and require \nreplacement of the gaskets and rework of the flange faces. \nThis work is performed during the refueling outage while \nthe reactor vessel head is on its storage stand. Remote \ntooling and appropriate shielding are used to minimize \nthe radiation dose to the workers.\nReactor head service support structures are designed \nfor several major functions. They provide cooling and \nlateral support for the CRDMs, support power and \ninstrumentation cables, facilitate reactor head lifts, and \nact as an internal missile shield. On some reactors the \noriginal service structures were not fully optimized to \nsimplify refueling activities. These original inefficiencies \ntogether with increased economic performance goals have \nresulted in the replacement of original service structures \nindependent of or in conjunction with RVCH replacement. \nThe primary objective of an enhanced service structure \n(ESS) is to reduce the disassembly and reassembly times \n", "char_count": 6780, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_52", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Nuclear Services, Life Extensions", "is_complete_section": true}}

These objectives \ncan be met by striving for a redesigned configuration \nthat integrates all functions into a single assembly \nwhich can be removed with a single point pickup after \ndisconnecting instrumentation, CRDM power cables and \nthe head closure studs. Service structure enhancement \ncan entail integrating the entire cooling system into the \nESS, missile shield integration and building in a single \npoint pickup tripod arrangement. Improvements to allow \nquick disconnects for cables and more efficient RVCH \nstud removal will also improve critical path time. Despite \nbuilding more functionality into the ESS, overall access \nfor reactor head inspections can be improved by providing \nhandholes and by spacing the RVCH insulation away \nfrom the head surface, thereby allowing remote visual \ninspection of the head with the insulation still in place.\nIntegrated head assembly\nA practice used during updates and life extensions, \nalong with steam generator replacements, is a replace­\nment reactor vessel closure head assembled with CRDMs \ninstalled in a temporary structure.\nThe first phase of the replacement process involves \nassembly of the new service structure and associated \ncomponents, followed by the CRDM assembly and motor \ndrive assemblies.\nWhen the plant is prepared to receive the new reactor \nvessel head, the head is set on its stand in containment. \nThe remaining sections, insulation, missile shields and \nrigging tripod can be set in place, and the head assembly \ncan then be located on the reactor. Lead screws and the \nposition indicator can then be placed in the motor drive \nassembly. Final installation steps are then completed \nincluding water line connections, cable connections and \ncooling ducts.\nIn-core instrumentation\nMost PWRs utilize in-core instrumentation inserted \nthrough the bottom of the reactor vessel. During refuel­\ning, these very long, slender rods are withdrawn from \nthe fuel assemblies. At that time, instruments that \nare not performing properly are replaced. Because the \ninstrument (detector) is radioactively hot, the end that \nwas in the core is pushed back into the reactor vessel \nand cut off using underwater remote tooling and is then \ndisposed. The remainder of the instrument is pulled out \nthe other end and also disposed. Additional inspections \nand maintenance to the sealing system can be performed. \nNew detectors are inserted for use during the next \noperating cycle.\nReactor coolant pumps\nDepending on the size of the plant, there are from two \nto four reactor coolant pumps in the primary system. \nBecause the pumps and motors are constantly engaged, \nthey require more maintenance than passive components. \nPump seals are the items most frequently replaced. \nNuclear plant motor maintenance is similar to that \nperformed in other industries, except that the motors are \nvery large, must operate with very little vibration, and \nmust be maintained within the reactor building.\nPump repair  While infrequent, pump repairs, \nother than seals, and general overhauls are important \nin a comprehensive maintenance program. Overhauls \nare conducted to minimize pump failures due to wear. \nBecause of the contaminated environment in which a \npump operates, special tooling is used when making \nrepairs to minimize radiation exposure to technicians.\nMechanical shaft seal maintenance  The mechanical \nshaft seal is a primary boundary for the reactor coolant. \nThe seals are typically a three stage design, with each \nsuccessive stage being subjected to a lower pressure drop. \nSealing is provided by rotating and stationary surfaces \nthat contact each other or are separated by a thin film. \nThe seal faces are typically carbon or aluminum oxide. \nBecause they must operate continuously in vibrating \nconditions with exceedingly low leakage, pump seals need \nregular attention and sometimes replacement during \noutage maintenance.\nPressurizer\nThe pressurizer serves to establish and control the \noperating pressure within the primary heat transport \nsystem. This is achieved by electrical heaters that raise \nthe saturation pressure of the pressurizer’s water and \nsteam inventory to the appropriate value.\nHeaters within the pressurizer are generally the only \ncomponents that require maintenance. These heaters \nconsist of side mounted bundles, used in B&W designs, \nor bottom mounted individual heaters, used in other pres­\nsurized water reactors. (See Fig. 12.) Heater maintenance \nprimarily consists of element/bundle replacement, power \ncable replacement, cable-to-element connector repair, and \nelement recovery.\nMoisture is often the cause of a defective heater \nelement. Element recovery can be done by drawing a \nvacuum at the electrical connector and sucking out the \nmoisture. If moisture is present in the connector area, the \nconnector pins may be damaged by arcing and may break \nwhen removing the power cable from the heater. This \ndamage may be repaired. However, if these intermediate \nrepairs are not successful, the heater element/bundle \nmust be replaced.\nInstrumentation and controls (IC)\nThe critical nature of and general inaccessibility \nto nuclear plant IC dictate that these components and \nsystems be extremely reliable. This reliability is achieved \nby stringent qualification and by incorporating multiple \nchannels to measure the same parameters. Such coin­\ncident logic reduces the possibility that a single failure \nwill trigger a safety action.\nIf a component fails suddenly or gradually degrades, \nthis must be detectable. Detection is achieved by monitor­\ning parameters with the plant computer and annunciator \nsystems and by alarming abnormal conditions.\nChecks are often made by comparing the output from \nredundant sensors. On critical components, these tests \nare run and documented at specified intervals. Channel \ncalibrations are performed routinely to ensure that \ninstrumentation and electrical devices meet specifica­\ntions for accuracy and response time. Integrated system \ntests may also be performed. If a device fails a test, it \nis replaced or declared inoperable.

All valves have their individual \nrequirements of opening and closing time, shutoff tight­\nness, monitorability, etc. In addition, the number of valves \nof all types in a nuclear plant is very large—and each \nvalve can change the configuration of the plant.\nTherefore, in a nuclear plant, a systematic main­\ntenance plan is mandatory. For example, a plan for \nmotorized isolation valves should address packing and \nseat leakage, opening and closing stroke times, actuator \noutput and lubrication, function of control switches, \nwear of internal actuator parts, and the reliability of its \ncontroller, etc.\nPiping \nPiping is subject to operating pressure and to imposed \nforces and motions due to its own thermal and pressure \nFig. 12  Pressurizer heater bundles – bottom mounted (left) and side \nmounted (right).\nFig. 13  Automated UT inspection of complex pipe shapes.\neffects and to those of the equipment it serves. Piping is \nsubject to stress, fatigue, cracking, corrosion, and to flow \naccelerated corrosion (FAC) which is an ongoing industry \nchallenge of pipe wall thinning and, in some cases, failure.\nPiping and pipe welds are examined using UT, liquid \npenetrant (PT) or magnetic particle testing (MT). Where \nUT is required, it may be performed manually or with \nautomated scanners. Complex shapes, such as nozzle \nintersections, can be scanned using robotic manipulators \nas depicted in Fig. 13. Robots and scanners provide \nprecise positioning and automatic data analysis with \nminimal personnel radiation exposure.\nEquipment diagnostics\nLoose parts monitoring  Loose parts, or foreign \nobjects, such as bolts and small metal pieces caught in the \nhigh velocity flow of the reactor coolant system can bounce \naround in the primary system and cause significant \ndamage to areas such as steam generator tubesheets and \nseal welds. While loose parts are seldom encountered, the \nNRC requires a system to detect them.

{"chunk_id": "unit_001_page_013", "page_number": 13, "text": "52-13\nSteam 42 / Nuclear Services, Life Extensions and Enhancements\nThe Babcock & Wilcox Company\nfeatures acoustic sensors in the primary system to detect \nloose parts. These sensors, or accelerometers, detect the \nnoise generated by impacting loose parts. The system \nrecords impact data and provides an audible alarm for \nimpacts beyond a prescribed energy level.\nForeign object damage to steam generator tubing \non the secondary side is also possible. Sources include \nthe windings of upstream valve gaskets which unravel \nin service or bits of metal, weld slag and tooling. In \nnew replacement steam generators with high corrosion \nresistance, foreign object damage is often the most \nsignificant remaining failure risk. The presence of foreign \nobjects and any damage is normally detected by eddy \ncurrent and/or visual tube inspection during an outage, \nas described earlier in this chapter.\nNeutron noise monitoring  The internals of the \nreactor vessel provide support for and alignment of the \ncore. Maintenance of both is important to assure that the \ncontrol rods can be inserted for reactivity control. The \ninternals are subjected to high velocity reactor coolant \nflow, which causes them to vibrate. Although some \nvibration is normal, excessive amounts must be detected. \nDuring power operations, neutron flux is monitored \nby special instrumentation located outside the reactor \nvessel. Certain characteristics of this neutron signal are \naffected by vibration of the reactor internals. Analysis \nof this signal can detect abnormal vibration patterns. \nMeasurements are typically made at the end of a fuel \ncycle and at the beginning of the next cycle to verify that \nthe internals are aligned and secure.\nReactor coolant pump monitoring  Two principal \npump characteristics are monitored: shaft vibration and \nseal performance. Accelerometers and noncontacting \ndisplacement probes located on the pump provide continu­\nous vibration monitoring. The displacement probes are \nmounted radially; the accelerometers are located on and \nnear the pump bearing. Monitoring equipment in or near \nthe control room records the sensor data and sounds an \nalarm if certain limits are exceeded.\nSeal performance is also monitored. Parameters \nsuch as seal cavity pressures, seal injection flow and \ntemperature indicate when seal replacement is needed.\nValve monitoring and diagnostics  The valve \npopulation of a typical nuclear plant is very large and \nall valves are critical to plant operation. Nuclear plant \nvalves control and direct flow, isolate systems and relieve \npressure. Motor operated valves (MOVs) and check valves \nare especially important because they provide isolation \nfor critical systems and are often required to operate \nunder severe temperature and pressure conditions. \nTo determine the condition of these valves, diagnostic \nsystems have been developed.\nMOVs provide isolation. They may remain open or \nclosed during plant operation. The ability of the MOVs \nto function is directly related to the thrust applied to \nthe valve stem to overcome differential pressure and \nsubsequent high friction. However, control switches \nlimit the thrust of the motor actuator to avoid damaging \nthe valves and internals. Special diagnostic systems \ndetermine the available thrust of the actuator and \nassure that the switches are properly set. Preventive \nmaintenance programs use the data generated by these \ndiagnostic systems.\nCheck valves are passive devices that only permit flow \nin one direction. Because the active parts of the valves are \nwholly contained in the fluid stream, it has been difficult \nto determine functionality without disassembly. However, \ndiagnostic systems that evaluate in-service check valves \nhave been developed. These systems use ultrasonics and \nacoustics to evaluate the disc position and the impact of \nthe disc on the seat and back stop. They can detect wear \nat the hinge pin and flutter of the disc, which can lead to \npremature failure. As with MOV diagnostics, data from \nthese systems are used in scheduling maintenance.\nRefueling\nMajor activities\nDuring refueling, approximately one-third of the fuel \nassemblies are removed and replaced and the remaining \nassemblies are usually moved inward within the core. \nScheduled maintenance is performed during refueling \noutages. Depending on the extent of maintenance \nrequired, either that maintenance or the refueling \noperation determines the length of the outage.\nFuel movement activities are centered around the \nreactor vessel and the spent fuel building. (See Fig. 14.) \nTo access the fuel, the reactor vessel must be opened. \nThe following major steps are involved in this process:\n1.\t remove the missile shields,\n2.\t vent the primary system,\n3.\t uncouple the control rods from their drives,\n4.\t raise and park the drive lead screws,\n5.\t disconnect the power to the control rod drives,\n6.\t install the canal seal plate,\n7.\t detension (loosen) and remove the reactor vessel \nstuds,\n8.\t install the guide studs,\n9.\t install the lifting rig, lift the vessel head and place \non a stand,\n10.\t install the internals guide fixture,\n11.\t raise the water level in the refueling canal,\n12.\tinstall the lift fixture, remove the upper internals \nand place on a stand under water, and\n13.\tretract and park in-core instruments (detectors).\nThe fuel can now be moved.\nFuel movement is performed underwater with \npermanently installed equipment. When each fuel \nassembly is removed, it is transferred to the on-site spent \nfuel storage area. Here, control rod assembly changes and \nthe appropriate inspections are made. Fuel that is to be \nreused is moved back to the reactor building and placed \nin its new core location; new fuel is also installed at this \ntime. Final verification of fuel assemblies is recorded \nwith underwater video equipment.\nFuel handling equipment\nFuel handling equipment can be grouped into three \nareas: 1) main fuel handling, 2) fuel transfer, and 3) spent \nfuel/new fuel handling. The main fuel handling system, \nused to remove and install fuel in the reactor vessel, \nconsists of a motorized bridge spanning the canal or cavity \nand riding on rails. A handling mast, mounted to and \nextending below the carriage, is positioned over the fuel \n", "char_count": 6269, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_52", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Nuclear Services, Life Extensions", "is_complete_section": true}}

The grapple, or gripping device, is \nthen lowered and engages the assembly. Once engaged, \nthe grapple is raised and the fuel is drawn into the hollow \nmast. Sensors indicating load and fuel assembly position \nassist the operator. The bridge is then moved to the fuel \ntransfer area, where the fuel is lowered into a vertical \ntransfer basket and released from the grapple. At this \npoint, the basket is lowered to the horizontal position \nand is moved through a transfer tube into the spent fuel \narea. Finally, the fuel is upended and moved to storage.\nThe main fuel handling and transfer systems are \nonly accessible during a plant shutdown because they \nare located inside the reactor building. As a result, \nmaintenance on this equipment is scheduled at the \nbeginning of an outage.\nReactor vessel disassembly and reassembly\nTo allow access to the fuel, the reactor vessel head and \nupper internals must be removed from the reactor vessel. \nIn the B&W nuclear steam supply system (NSSS), each \ncontrol rod drive must be disconnected from its control \nrod before this operation can begin. The control rod \nremains with the fuel. Special tooling is used to reach \ndown through the top of the drive, and to attach to and \nrotate the lead screw and disconnect it from the control \nrod. The lead screw is then raised and parked inside the \ndrive assembly. Other NSSS designs require similar \nprocedures; however, the sequence and exact techniques \nmay differ.\nThe tensioned studs and nuts that secure the reactor \nvessel head to the reactor vessel must be detensioned \nand removed before fuel handling can continue. A typical \nhydraulic detensioning operation is shown in Fig. 15. \nGenerally, three detensioners are used simultaneously \nand follow a prescribed pattern. Once the studs are de­\ntensioned, they are screwed out of the threaded holes in \nthe reactor vessel flange and either removed or parked on \nthe head. A lifting fixture is then attached to the head. \nThe head is then raised using the reactor building crane \nand moved aside to its storage stand inside the reactor \nbuilding.\nThe upper internals are lifted in a similar manner; \nhowever, due to their highly contaminated and activated \nnature, the lifting fixture is attached remotely. The \nupper internals are stored on a stand under water in the \nrefueling cavity.\nFig. 14  On-site fuel movement system.\n", "char_count": 2493, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_52", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Nuclear Services, Life Extensions", "is_complete_section": true}}
