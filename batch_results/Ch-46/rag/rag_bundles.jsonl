These questions typically pertained to tubing and \nheaders, which caused the majority of downtime. In recent \nyears, new capacity additions have focused attention to \ncombined cycle and simple cycle plants firing natural gas \nas the installed base of field erected boilers continues to \nage. Longer service time and an increased use of boiler \ncycling (both load and on/off cycling) have made the need \nfor routine condition assessment programs more critical \nthan ever. Condition assessment programs evaluate \nboiler components to help avoid component failure and \nunscheduled outages. Changes in the power generation \nindustry have also resulted in more unpredictability of an \nasset’s future, leading many boiler owners to place units \ninto long out-of-service periods. If not properly stored, \nthese idle periods can introduce the potential for increased \ncomponent degradation from corrosion and oxidation.\nCondition assessment includes the use of tools or \nmethods in the evaluation of specific components and \nthen the interpretation of the results to identify 1) the \ncomponent’s remaining life, 2) the safe reinspection \ninterval, and 3) areas requiring immediate attention. \nCondition assessment programs must expand in response \nto the increasing age of boilers to include additional com­\nponents which were historically not part of the targeted \ncomponents to be examined.\nA boiler component’s damage assessment, typically \ncompared to its design life, is based on accumulated \ndamage, and can be performed in three phases. In Phase \n1 of the assessment, design and overall operating records \nare reviewed and interviews are held with operating \npersonnel. In Phase 2, nondestructive examinations, \nstress analysis, verification of dimensions, and operat­\ning parameters are undertaken. If required, the more \ncomplex Phase 3 includes finite element analysis, \noperational testing and evaluation, and material proper­\nties measurement.1 (See Fig. 1.)\nCondition Assessment Examination \nMethods\nThe major boiler components must be examined by \nnondestructive and destructive tests to accurately gauge \ntheir condition and plan the course of maintenance and \nreplacement outage work.\nChapter 46\nCondition Assessment\nFig. 1  Three phases (levels) of boiler damage assessment (courtesy \nof the Electric Power Research Institute).1\nNondestructive examinations\nMost nondestructive examination (NDE) methods for \nfossil fuel-fired plants have been in use for many years, \nalthough new methods are being developed for major \ncomponents.

However, the value of the data and the level of \nconfidence applied to decisions from data analysis are \na direct function of the NDE reliability. NDE service \nproviders should have well documented programs with \nformal procedures, training programs and certification \ndocumentation. A key to NDE in boiler assessment is \ncomplete and accurate recording of location to allow \nroot cause evaluation of any component problems that \nare identified. The technician or lead contractor’s \nknowledge of the nomenclature, along with the use of \nmarked drawings, sketches and complete descriptions is \ncritical. In addition, depending on the type of NDE, the \npreparation for testing directly impacts the quality of the \nresults—access to testing locations, proper lighting and \ncomponent surface preparation are important factors for \nmost NDE processes.\nVisual  Whether the inspected component is subject \nto mechanical wear, chemical attack, or damage from \nthermal stress, visual examination can detect and iden­\ntify some of the damage. Visual inspection is enhanced \nby lighting, magnification, mirrors and optical equipment \nsuch as borescopes, fiberscopes and binoculars. Special \ncertifications and training, such as the Certified Welding \nInspector training, are available to enhance the value of \nvisual inspection results for specific applications.\nMagnetic particle  Magnetic particle testing (MT) \nand wet fluorescent magnetic particle testing (WFMT) \ndetect surface and near surface flaws. Because a magnetic \nfield must be imparted to the test piece, these tests are \nonly applicable to ferromagnetic materials.2 The choice \nbetween these techniques generally depends on the \ngeometry of the component and the required sensitivity. \nFor typical power plant applications, one of two methods \nis used: 1) the component is indirectly magnetized using \nan electromagnetic yoke with alternating current (AC), \nor 2) the part is directly magnetized by prods driven by \nAC or direct current (DC).\nIn magnetic particle testing, surface or near surface \ndiscontinuities disrupt the lines of magnetic force \npassing through the test area creating a leakage field. \nIron particles applied to the area accumulate along the \nlines of magnetic force. Any leakage field created by a \ndiscontinuity is easily identified by the pattern of the \niron particles. Dry magnetic particle testing is performed \nusing a dry medium composed of colored iron particles \nthat are dusted onto the magnetized area. In areas \nwhere a dry medium is ineffective, such as when testing \noverhead components or the inside surfaces of pressure \nvessels, the wet fluorescent method is more effective. \nWith this method, fluorescent ferromagnetic particles are \nsuspended in a liquid medium such as oil (kerosene) or \nwater. The liquid-borne particles adhere to the test area. \nBecause the particles are fluorescent, they are highly \nvisible when viewed under an ultraviolet light.\nLiquid penetrant  Liquid penetrant testing (PT) \ndetects surface cracking in a component. PT is not \ndependent on the magnetic properties of the material and \nis less dependent on component geometry.2 It is used by \nThe Babcock & Wilcox Company (B&W) in limited access \nareas such as tube stub welds on high temperature head­\ners which are generally closely spaced. PT detects surface \nflaws by capillary action of the liquid dye penetrant and \nis only effective where the discontinuity is open to the \ncomponent surface. Following proper surface cleaning \nthe liquid dye is applied. The penetrant is left on the \ntest area for about ten minutes to allow it to penetrate \nthe discontinuity. A cleaner is used to remove excess \npenetrant and the area is allowed to dry. A developer \nis then sprayed onto the surface. Any dye that has been \ndrawn into the surface at a crack bleeds into the developer \nby reverse capillary action and becomes highly visible.\nUltrasonic  Ultrasonic testing (UT) is one of the \nmost dynamic technologies for nondestructive testing of \npressure components. Numerous specialized UT methods \nhave been developed and continue to be investigated. \nUT utilizes a piezoelectric transducer that is placed in \ncontact with the test material, causing disturbances in \nthe interatomic spacings and inducing an elastic sound \nwave that moves through the material.3 The ultrasonic \nwave is reflected and/or refracted by any discontinuity \nit encounters as it passes through the material. The \nreflected wave is received back at the transducer and is \ndisplayed on an oscilloscope.\nUltrasonic thickness testing  Ultrasonic thickness \ntesting (UTT) is the most basic ultrasonic technology. A \ncommon cause of pressure part failure is wall loss (wall \nthinning) due to oxidation, corrosion or erosion. UTT is \nrelatively fast and is used extensively for measuring the \nremaining actual wall thicknesses of tubes or piping.\nThe surface of the component must first be thoroughly \ncleaned. Because ultrasonic waves do not pass through \nair, a couplant such as glycerine, a water soluble gel, is \nbrushed onto the surface. The transducer is then posi­\ntioned onto the component surface within the couplant. \nA high frequency (2 to 5 MHz) signal is transmitted \nby the transducer and passes through the metal. UTT \nis performed using a longitudinal wave which travels \nperpendicular to the contacted surface. Because the travel \ntime for the reflected wave varies with distance, the metal \nthickness is determined by the signal displacement, as \nshown on the oscilloscope screen. (See Fig. 2.)\nUltrasonic oxide measurement  In the mid-1980s, \nB&W developed an ultrasonic technique specifically to \nevaluate high temperature tubing found in superheaters \nand reheaters.

{"chunk_id": "unit_001_page_003", "page_number": 3, "text": "46-3\nSteam 42 / Condition Assessment\nThe Babcock & Wilcox Company\ntive Oxide Thickness Inspection Service (NOTIS®), \nmeasures the oxide layer on the internal surfaces of \nhigh temperature tubes. The NOTIS transducer is \nplaced on the outside diameter (OD) surface of the tube, \nand ultrasonic sound is used to measure the internal \noxide thickness. The test is generally applicable to low \nalloy steels up to and including 9% chromium materials \ncommonly used in outlet sections of the superheater and \nreheater.\nLow alloy steels develop an oxide layer on their \ninternal surfaces when exposed to high temperatures \nfor long time periods. (See Fig. 3.) The NOTIS test is \nnot generally applicable to stainless steels because they \nusually develop a thinner oxide layer with time that is \nnot reliably measurable.\nThe technique used for NOTIS testing is similar to \nUTT; the major difference between the two techniques \nis the frequency range of the ultrasonic signal. A much \nhigher frequency is necessary to differentiate the \ninterface between the oxide layer and inside diameter (ID) \nsurface of the tube. Using data obtained from the NOTIS \ntesting, tube remaining creep life can also be calculated \nas discussed later in Analysis Techniques. NOTIS and \nUTT are methods in which the transducer is placed in \ncontact with the tube using a couplant gel. Because of the \nhigh sensitivity of the NOTIS method, it is less tolerant \nof rough tube surfaces or poor surface preparation.\nUltrasonic measurement of internal tube damage \nSeveral ultrasonic methods have been investigated for \ndetecting damage within boiler tubes. All techniques use \ncontact UT where a transducer is placed on the OD or \ntube surface using a couplant, and an ultrasonic signal is \ntransmitted through the material. The techniques can be \ncategorized by the type of signal evaluation: backscatter, \nthe evaluation of UT wave scatter when reflected by dam­\naged material; attenuation, the evaluation of UT signal \nloss associated with transmission through damaged \nmaterial; and velocity, the measurement and comparison \nof UT wave velocity through the tube material.4\nWhen a longitudinal wave passes through a tube, part \nof the signal is not reflected to the receiver if it encounters \ndamaged material. The damaged areas reflect part of \nthe wave at various angles, backscattering the reflected \nsignal. The loss of wave amplitude that is received back \nat the transducer is then used to evaluate the degree of \ndamage.\nDamage in the tube can also be assessed by evaluating \nthe loss of signal amplitude (attenuation) as a shear wave \nis transmitted through the tube wall. The technique uses \na fixture with two transducers mounted at angles to each \nother. One unit transmits a shear wave into the tube and \nthe second transducer, the receiver, picks up the signal as \nthe wave is reflected from the tube ID. A drop in signal \namplitude indicates damage in the tube wall.\nImmersion ultrasonic testing  In immersion ultrasonic \ntesting, the part is placed in a water bath which acts as \nthe couplant. This procedure is common for inspection \nof parts in manufacturing quality control applications. \nFor boiler assessment, a form of immersion UT is applied \nto tube wall thickness measurements. In two-drum \nindustrial power boilers, process recovery boilers, and \nsome utility power generation boilers, most of the tubes in \nthe convective bank between the drums are inaccessible \nfor conventional contact UTT measurements. For these \napplications, an ultrasonic test probe was developed \nwhich is inserted into the tubes from the steam drum. \nImmersion UT is possible because ultrasonic sound \nwaves travel through water. By flooding the tubes to a \npoint just below the steam drum, it is possible to perform \nmeasurements without the need to maintain intimate \ncontact with the tube surface. The immersion test \nmeasures the wall thickness from inside the tubes. As \nthe probe is withdrawn in measured increments, one or \nmore transducers measure the tube wall thicknesses. A \nlimitation of this technique is that the ID surface of the \ntubes must be relatively clean.\nOne variation of this technique, called the internal \nrotary inspection system (IRIS), uses a fixed center \ntransducer with a high speed rotating mirror to reflect \nthe UT signal around the inside tube circumference to \ndevelop a continuous wall thickness mapping. IRIS is \ncommonly used for assessing tubing with limited external \naccess. A second version of internal UT is referred to as \nnear drum inspection. Process recovery boilers in the pulp \nand paper industry can experience OD tube corrosion in \nthe area adjacent to the lower drum penetration. Near \ndrum UT uses a special fixture that is inserted from the \nlower drum opening while plugging the tube opening. A \nsmall amount of water floods the lower area at the tube \nvia the fixture and UT is performed. This technique limits \nthe amount of water and can be done one tube at a time.\nShear wave ultrasonic testing  This is a contact \nultrasonic technique in which a shear wave is directed at \nan angle into the test material. Angles of 45 and 60 deg \n(0.79 and 1.05 rad) are typically used for defect detection \nand weld assessment. The entire weld must be inspected \nfor a quality examination. Shear wave applications have \nbeen developed in many configurations.

This method \nis particularly dependent upon calibration standards \nwith known defects or notches that are used to set UT \nequipment sensitivity and compare to in situ test results.\nTime of flight diffraction (TOFD)  This method is an \nultrasonic technique that relies on the diffraction of \nultrasonic energies from defects in the component being \ntested. The primary application is weld inspection on pip­\ning, pressure vessels and tanks. TOFD is an automated \ninspection that uses a pitch-catch arrangement with two \nprobes, one on each side of the weld. The weld material \nis saturated with angled longitudinal waves to inspect \nfor discontinuities. Because the time separation of the \ndiffracted waves is directly related to flaw size (height), \nTOFD can both detect the flaw and allow estimation of \nthe flaw size.\nPhased array  Typical UT applications use a single \ntransducer element or crystal to generate or receive the \nultrasonic signal energy. UT transducers have limitations \nthat are dependent on design and that limit the sensitivity \nof flaw detection and characterization. Phased array \ntransducers utilize a series of UT elements which are fired \nor pulsed sequentially to create a complementary wave \nform in the test piece. This allows for a more focused wave \nthan previously possible. Phased arrays are possible due \nto the advance of solid-state circuits and microcomputers \nthat have led to economical and portable field instruments. \nTypically, other UT techniques described above are used \nfor scanning welds and components while phased array \ntechniques may be used for more accurate measurement \nand sizing of flaws or discontinuities.\nPhased array has proven effective in assessing the \npresence of certain types of creep damage in boiler materi­\nals which are not detectable by other NDE methods. One \nof the biggest advantages offered by phased array UT is \nits ability to inspect a weld or component with multiple \nangles from a single probe. Conventional angle beam \ninspection is typically performed using a minimum of \ntwo angles with each angle requiring separate equipment \nsetup and individual scans of the weld or component \nbeing tested. Phased array UT can simultaneously cover \na range of angles, significantly speeding the inspection \nprocess and improving the detection of flaws and internal \nirregularities.\nB&W developed a unique application of the phased \narray UT inspection that is used during the manufacture \nof high temperature headers. The complex geometry \nof the tube-to-header welds and penetrations into the \nheader make this a particularly difficult area to inspect \nby traditional NDE such as radiography. Phased array \nUT is used in special fixtures to perform volumetric weld \nexamination of the tube welds and to find subsurface \nflaws as part of the quality control process.\nEddy current  Measuring the effects of induced eddy \ncurrents on the primary or driving electromagnetic field \nis the basis of eddy current testing. The electromagnetic \ninduction needed for eddy current testing is created by \nusing an alternating current. This develops the electro­\nmagnetic field necessary to produce eddy currents in a \ntest piece.\nEddy current testing is applicable to any material that \nconducts electricity and can be performed on magnetic and \nnonmagnetic materials. The test is therefore applicable \nto all metals encountered in power station condition \nassessment work.\nParameters affecting eddy current testing include the \nresistivity, conductivity and magnetic permeability of the \ntest material; the frequency of the current producing the \neddy currents; and the geometry and thickness of the \ncomponent being tested. In power plants, conventional \nhigh frequency eddy current testing is used extensively for \nnonferromagnetic tubing inspections such as condensers. \nLower frequency eddy current applications, such as \nremote field, have also been developed for ferromagnetic \nmaterials including boiler tube inspection.\nRadiography  Radiography testing (RT) is the most \ncommon nonvisual NDE method historically used during \nfield erection of a boiler. Radiography is also valuable in \ncondition assessments of piping. The energy for RT can \nbe produced electronically, as in the case of x-rays, or \nby natural radioactive isotopes that emit gamma rays. \nIn RT, x-rays or gamma rays are directed through a \nmaterial. Some of the rays are absorbed, with the degree \nof absorption dependent upon material thickness, crystal \nstructure and density. When the rays passing through \nan object are exposed to a special film, an image of the \nobject is produced due to the partial absorption of the rays.\nIn practical terms, a radioactive source is placed on \none side of a component, such as a pipe, at a weld, and \na film is placed on the opposite side. If x-rays or gamma \nrays are directed through the weld and there is a void \nwithin the weld, more rays pass through this void and \nreach the film, producing a darker image at that point. \nBy examining the radiographic films, the weld integrity \ncan be determined. During the field erection of a boiler \nand power station, thousands of tube and pipe welds are \nmade and radiographed. (See also Chapters 39 and 40.)\nThe major disadvantage of traditional radiography \nused in the field is the harmful effect excessive exposure to \nradioactive rays can have on humans. Work areas located \nnear where RT is being performed must be restricted \nwhich can limit other work activity and overall project \nschedule. RT is also limited in its ability to provide the \norientation and depth of an indication.\nDigital radiography  Digital radiography is a form \nof RT, sometimes referred to as computed RT, that has \nbecome more widespread in industrial use. Digital \nRT uses portable x-ray sources along with a phosphor \nplate in place of conventional film. The phosphor plate \nreceives the image and is scanned by a computer scanner \nto capture and present the image. The advantages of \ndigital radiography are the flexibility and sensitivity of \nthe testing, the capturing of an electronic record which \ncan be evaluated, and the use of low power radioactive \nsources. The lower power source reduces radioactivity in \nthe area and allows work to continue in adjacent areas \nof the boiler.\nX-ray fluorescence  The primary use of this testing \nin condition assessment is the verification of alloy materi­\nals in high temperature piping systems and it is usually \nreferred to as positive material identification (PMI). \nWhen metals are exposed to an external source of x-rays \nthey fluoresce (emit) additional x-rays at specific energy \n", "char_count": 6916, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_46", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Condition Assessment", "is_complete_section": true}}

Portable instruments that contain a low level \nradioactive source or miniature x-ray tube can rapidly \nidentify elements common to high temperature piping \nand headers such as chromium and molybdenum. For \nexample, a point on the surface of the pipe can be exposed \nto radiation emitted from the analyzer. As the source \nx-rays interact with the atoms of the metal, the alloy \nelements emit x-rays back to the PMI analyzer. Within \nthe detector system of the analyzer, the fluoresced x-rays \nare separated into discrete energy regions to determine \nthe elements that are present. By measuring the radiation \nintensity in each energy region, the elemental composition \nis also determined by the PMI device.\nElectromagnetic acoustics  Electromagnetic acous-\ntics combine two nondestructive testing sciences, \nultrasonics (UT) and electromagnetic induction. \nThis technology uses an electromagnetic acoustic \ntransducer (EMAT) to generate high frequency sound \nwaves in materials, similar to conventional ultrasonics. \nConventional UT transducers used for field testing \nconvert electrical impulses to mechanical pulses by use \nof piezoelectric crystals. These crystals must be coupled \nto the test piece through a fluid couplant. For electrically \nconductive materials, ultrasonic waves can be produced \nby electromagnetic acoustic wave generation.5 In contrast \nto conventional contact UT where a mechanical pulse is \ncoupled to the material, the acoustic wave is produced \nby the interaction of two magnetic sources. The first \nmagnetic source modulates a time-dependent magnetic \nfield by electromagnetic induction as in eddy current \ntesting. A second constant magnetic field provided by an \nAC- or DC-driven electromagnet or a permanent magnet \nis positioned near the first field. The interaction of these \ntwo fields generates a force, called the Lorentz force, in \nthe direction perpendicular to the two other fields. This \nLorentz force interacts with the material to produce a \nshock wave analogous to an ultrasonic pulse, eliminating \nthe need for a couplant.\nFig. 4 shows the basic principles of EMAT operation. A \nstrong magnetic field (B) is produced at the surface of the \ntest piece by either a permanent magnet or electromagnet. \nEddy currents (J) are induced in the test material \nsurface. An alternating eddy flow in the presence of the \nmagnetic field generates a Lorentz force (F) that produces \nan ultrasonic wave in the material. For boiler tubes that \nare electromagnetically conductive (including alloys such \nas SA-213T22), the EMAT technology is ideal.\nB&W, working with the Electric Power Research \nInstitute (EPRI), developed a nondestructive rapid scan \nsystem to inspect boiler tubes using EMAT technology. \nThis EMAT-based system, known as the Fast-Scanning \nThickness Gage (FST-GAGE®) system, was developed \nspecifically to scan boiler tubes and provide a continu­\nous measurement of tube wall thickness. (See chapter \nfrontispiece.) The system allows for exceptional speeds \nwhich enable thousands of feet (m) of boiler tubing to be \nscanned in a single shift. To perform an inspection, the \nFST-GAGE system is manually scanned along individual \nboiler tubes. System sampling rates greater than 65 \nsamples per second support rapid scanning of tubes. \nDuring a scan, the system provides an immediate display \nof both tube wall thickness and signal amplitude. At the \nconclusion of each tube scan, a complete record of the \ninspection is electronically stored and is traceable to each \nboiler tube and position.\nAs with conventional UT, the FST-GAGE inspection \nsystem can assess internal tube damage by evaluating \nthe loss of signal amplitude (attenuation) as a shear wave \nis transmitted through the tube wall. By monitoring and \nindicating signal amplitude, the system can also be used \nto detect internal tube damage such as hydrogen damage. \nThe FST-GAGE inspection system has also demonstrated \nthe ability to detect internal tube pitting, caustic gouging \nand under-deposit corrosion.\nAs with any NDE method, surface preparation is \nimportant for effective testing with EMATs. However, \nEMAT is not as sensitive to scale as conventional UT since \nit produces the ultrasonic wave within the material. Some \nscales, such as magnetite oxide of uniform thickness, \nhave no detrimental effect on the signal generation of the \nEMAT probe. Grit blasting or water blasting are effective \nmethods of cleaning larger areas for EMAT testing. \nSmooth metal surfaces are preferred to ensure accurate \ntube wall thickness measurements and to minimize wear \non scanning probe coils.\nB&W has continued to apply EMAT technology where \nits unique properties have advantages compared to \nconventional UT techniques. For example, EMAT equip­\nment that produces a tone burst EMAT signal has been \ndeveloped which allows the use of horizontally polarized \nshear waves to detect cracking adjacent to external tube \nattachment welds. B&W developed an EMAT application \nto inspect horizontal (i.e., economizer, reheater) banks \nof tubing within the boiler. Horizontal bank tubing may \nexperience tube failures caused by out-of-service corrosion \npitting forming aligned voids in the tube ID. The purpose \nof this EMAT test is to detect the internal aligned pitting \nat the lower portion of the horizontal tube internal \nsurface. The test is accomplished by scanning along the \noutside of the horizontal tube at either the 3 or 9 o’clock \npositions with an EMAT transducer generating a Lamb \nwave (ultrasonic waves that travel at right angles to the \ntube surface) which is focused at the 6 o’clock position \non the tube.\nB&W has also developed a surface wave EMAT \napplication to show surface indications, including \naxially oriented cracks in boiler tubes. Conventional \nsurface nondestructive test methods were unsatisfactory \nbecause they lacked adequate sensitivity and had slow \nproduction rates for testing on large areas.

{"chunk_id": "unit_001_page_006", "page_number": 6, "text": "46-6\nSteam 42 / Condition Assessment\nThe Babcock & Wilcox Company\nEMAT technique was developed that uses a bidirectional \nfocused surface wave EMAT that follows the tube surface \ncircumferentially until the signal is reflected back from \na longitudinally orientated OD crack.\nAcoustics  Acoustics refers to the use of transmitted \nsound waves for nondestructive testing. It is differentiated \nfrom ultrasonics and electromagnetic acoustics in that it \nfeatures low frequency, audible sound. One application \nof this acoustic technology is the testing of tubular air \nheaters. Because the sound waves are low frequency, \nthey can be transmitted through air. A pulse of sound is \nsent into the air heater tube. As the wave travels along \nthe tube, it is reflected by holes, blockage or partial \nobstructions. By evaluating the reflected wave on an \noscilloscope, the type of flaw and its location along the \ntube are determined.\nAcoustic emissions  Acoustic emissions (AE) is used \nto detect subsurface crack growth in pressure vessels. \nWhen a structure such as a pipe is pressurized and \nheated, the metal experiences mechanical and thermal \nstresses. Due to the stress concentration at a defect such \nas a crack, a small overall stress in the pipe can produce \nlocalized yield and fracture stresses resulting in plastic \ndeformation. These localized yields release bursts of \nenergy or stress wave emissions that are commonly called \nacoustic emissions. AE testing uses acoustic transducers \nthat are positioned along the vessel being monitored. AE \nsignals are received at various transducers on the vessel. \nBy measuring the time required for the signal to reach \neach of the transducers, the data can be interpreted to \nidentify the location of the defect.\nAcoustic leak detection  Acoustic leak detection is an \napplication that has widespread use in the boiler industry. \nIt uses the theory of acoustics in permanent leak detection \nsystems. Although not associated directly with condition \nassessment programs, these leak detection systems have \nbeen installed in areas of aging components to help \nmitigate the potential impact of a failure by providing \nearly warning to plant personnel. Leak detection systems \nhave been installed using sensors that identify both \nairborne acoustic sound waves and metalborne acoustic \nemissions associated with leaks.\nMetallographic replication  Metallographic replica­\ntion is an in situ test method that creates an image of \nthe metal grain structure which can be nondestructively \nlifted from a component. Replication is important in \nevaluating high temperature headers and piping because \nit allows the structure to be examined for creep damage. \nPrior to the use of replication techniques, it was neces­\nsary to destructively remove samples of the material for \nlaboratory analysis. The replication process involves \ngrinding the surface with successively finer grits of \nabrasive, followed by final polishing with diamond paste \nand alumina to produce a finish of 1 micron or better. The \npolished surface is etched by applying a mixture of nitric \nacid and methanol in solution which preferentially attacks \nthe grain boundaries of the metal. Finally, a plastic tape \nis softened and then laid on the prepared surface. When \nthe replica tape has hardened, it is removed and mounted \nonto a glass slide for microscopic examination.\nStrain measurement  Strain measurements are \nobtained nondestructively by using strain gauges. \nGauges used for piping measurements are characterized \nby an electrical resistance that varies as a function of \nthe applied mechanical strain.6 For high temperature \ncomponents, the gauge is made of an alloy, such as \nplatinum-tungsten, which can be used at temperatures up \nto 1200F (649C). The gauge is welded to the surface of the \npipe and the strain is measured as the pipe ramps through \na temperature-pressure cycle to operating temperature. \nStrain gauges used for lower temperature applications \nsuch as for analysis of hanger support rods are made \nof conventional copper-nickel alloy (constantan). These \nlow temperature gauges are made of thin foil bonded to \na flexible backing and are attached to the test surface \nby a special adhesive.\nTemperature measurement  Most temperature \nmeasurements can be obtained with sheathed thermo­\ncouples (TC). In special applications where temperature \ngradients are needed, such as detailed stress analysis of \nheader ligaments, special embedded TCs are used. The \nembedded unit is constructed by drilling a small hole \ninto the header. A sheathed TC wire is then inserted and \npeened in place. (See Chapter 41.)\nThermal imaging  Thermal imaging cameras are also \nused primarily as a qualitative measurement to evaluate \nthe integrity of boiler settings. Thermal imaging is an \neffective tool to detect hot spots and loss of insulation \nintegrity, gas leakage and other loss of thermal energy.\nDestructive examinations\nIn its condition assessment of boiler components, B&W \ntries to minimize the use of sample analysis because it is \ngenerally more expensive to perform destructive testing. \nHowever, for certain components, complete evaluation can \nonly be done by removing and analyzing test samples. \nDestructive test samples may also be required when it is \nnecessary to proceed to a Phase 3 remaining useful life \n(RUL) analysis as part of the overall component condition \nassessment. Destructive testing is described for two types \nof specimens: tube samples and boat samples.\nTube samples  Tubes are the most common destruc­\ntively tested components. Tube samples are generally \nremoved from both water- and steam-cooled circuits. A \nrelatively large number of samples may be removed for \nvisual inspections, from which a smaller number are \nselected for complete laboratory analysis. A tube analysis \nusually includes the following: 1) as-received sample \nphoto documentation, 2) complete visual inspection under \nmagnification, 3) dimensional evaluation of a ring section \nremoved from the sample, 4) material verification by \nspectrographic analysis, 5) optical metallography, and \n6) material hardness measurement. On waterwall tubes \nremoved from the boiler furnace, the analysis includes a \nmeasurement of the internal deposit loading [g/ft2 (g/m2)] \nand elemental composition of the deposit. On steam-cooled \nsuperheater and reheater tubes, the thickness of the high \ntemperature oxide layer is also provided.\nSpecialized tests are performed as required to provide \nmore in-depth information. Failure analysis is a common \nexample. When failures occur in which the root cause is \nnot readily known from standard tests, fractography is \nperformed. Fractography involves the examination of the \nfracture surface using a scanning electron microscope.\nBoat samples  Boat samples are wedge shaped slices \nremoved from larger components such as headers, piping \n", "char_count": 6902, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_46", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Condition Assessment", "is_complete_section": true}}

The shape of the cut allows the material \nto be replaced by welding. Because the repairs usually \nrequire post-weld heat treating, the use of boat samples \nis expensive. The boat or plug sample can subsequently be \nmachined into a tensile test specimen for metallurgical \nlaboratory evaluation. In most instances, replication \nis adequate for metallographic examination of these \ncomponents and boat sample removal is not required.\nCondition Assessment of Boiler \nComponents and Auxiliaries\nIn Phase 1 of a condition assessment program, \ninterviews of plant personnel and review of historical \nmaintenance records help identify problem components. \nThese components are targeted for a closer on-site exami­\nnation during Phase 2 of the program. Nondestructive \nand destructive examination methods can then be used \nto evaluate the remaining life of the boiler’s components \nand major auxiliaries.\nBoiler drums\nSteam drum  The steam drum is the most expensive \nboiler component and must be included in any comprehen­\nsive condition assessment program. There are two types of \nsteam drums: the all-welded design used predominantly \nin electric utilities where the operating pressures exceed \n1800 psi (12.4 MPa), and drums with rolled tubes for \nlower pressure boilers. The steam drum operates at \nsaturation temperature [less than 700F (371C)]. Because \nof this relatively low operating temperature, the drum \nis made of carbon steel and is not subject to significant \ncreep. Creep is defined as increasing strain at a constant \nstress over time.\nRegardless of drum type, damage has most often been \nattributed to internal metal loss. The causes of metal loss \ninclude: corrosion and oxidation, which can occur during \nextended outages; acid attack; oxygen pitting; and chelant \nattack which are all discussed in Chapter 43. Damage can \nalso occur from mechanical and thermal stresses on the \ndrum that concentrate at nozzle and attachment welds. \nThese stresses, most often associated with boilers that \nare on/off cycled, can result in crack development. Cyclic \noperation can lead to drum distortion (humping) due to \ntop-to-bottom temperature differentials, and can result \nin concentrated stresses at the major support welds, seam \nwelds, and girth welds. The feedwater penetration area \nhas the greatest thermal differential because incoming \nfeedwater can be several hundred degrees below drum \ntemperature.\nA problem unique to steam drums with rolled tube \nseats is tube seat weepage (slight seeping of water through \nthe rolled joint). If the leak is not stopped, the joint, with \nits high residual stresses from the tube rolling operation, \ncan experience caustic embrittlement. (See Chapter 43.) \nIn addition, the act of eliminating the tube seat leak \nby repeated tube rolling can overstress the drum shell \nbetween tube seats and lead to ligament cracking.\nCondition assessment of the steam drum can include \nvisual and fiber optic scope examination, MT, PT, WFMT, \nUT and replication.\nLower drum  The lower or mud drum is most often \nfound in industrial boilers. (See Chapter 27.) Part of \nthe boiler’s water circuit, the lower drum is not subject \nto large thermal differentials or mechanical stresses. \nHowever, as in steam drums with rolled tubes, seat \nweepage and excessive stresses from tube rolling can \noccur. In most cases, visual inspection, including fiber \noptic probe examination of selected tube penetrations, is \nsufficient. Kraft recovery boiler lower drums are subject \nto corrosion of the tube-drum interface on the OD. This \narea of the drum is inaccessible, therefore inspections \nare conducted from the ID using UT methods to check \nfor cracking and wall thinning.\nThe downcomers carry water from the steam drum to \nthe mud drum and the various wall circuits. Two areas on \nthe downcomers that should be inspected are termination \nwelds for cracks and horizontal runs of piping for internal \ncorrosion pitting and thinning.\nBoiler tubing \nSteam-cooled  Steam-cooled tubing is found in the \nsuperheater and reheat superheater. Both components \nhave tubes subjected to the effects of metal creep. Creep \nis a function of temperature, stress and operating time. \nThe creep life of the superheater tubes is reduced by \nhigher than expected operating temperature, thermal \ncycling, and by other damage mechanisms, such as \nerosion and corrosion, causing tube wall thinning and \nincreased stresses. Excessive stresses associated with \nthermal expansion and mechanical loading can also \noccur, leading to tube cracks and leaks independent of \nthe predicted creep life.\nAs discussed in Chapters 19, 21 and 29, superheater \ntubing can also experience erosion, corrosion, and inter­\nacting combinations of both.\nCondition assessment of the superheater tubes \nincludes visual inspection, NOTIS, UTT and tube sample \nanalysis. Problems due to erosion, corrosion, expansion \nor excessive temperature will generally produce outward \nsigns such as distortion and surface conditions that can \nbe located by visual examination.\nDissimilar metal weld (DMW)  Dissimilar metal weld \ndescribes the weld transition between ferritic alloys, such \nas SA-213T22, and austenitic stainless tubing materials. \nSuperheater and reheater outlet banks are often made \nof stainless steel to address the higher temperatures \nin these hottest banks. Outlet headers are commonly \nSA-335P22 alloy material with SA-213T22 stubs in the \nunheated legs located in the penthouse or vestibule. The \ntransition, or DMW, from stainless to T22 material is \nsubject to creep degradation as the unit ages. Degradation \nof the DMW is not readily identified by NDE methods \nand can fail suddenly without warning. DMWs can be \nassessed by using the NOTIS test to locate the alloy outlet \nlegs with the highest oxide (indicator of tubes with highest \nhistorical operating temperature) or by the use of tube \nthermocouples that indicate outlet steam temperature \nduring operation. DMW tube samples should be removed \nfrom the hottest locations for laboratory analysis to \nassess creep.\nStainless steels  The advent of higher operating \ntemperatures in modern utility boilers has led to much \ngreater use of austenitic stainless steels in superheaters \nand reheaters. The stainless in these components develops \na relatively thin layer of iron oxide during operation.

{"chunk_id": "unit_001_page_008", "page_number": 8, "text": "46-8\nSteam 42 / Condition Assessment\nThe Babcock & Wilcox Company\nphenomenon associated with these units is shedding of \nthis oxide layer when the boiler cools during outages. \nThough the oxide layer is thin, the large volume of \nexfoliated scale dropping from internal surfaces can \ncause a blockage in lower tube bends. The blockage of flow \ncan cause tube overheating and can lead to tube failure. \nThe shedding problem is expected to decrease over time \nand is of greatest concern in the early years of operation \nwhen exfoliation volume is at its peak. One approach to \nhelp limit the amount of exfoliation is to plan for more \nfrequent unit outages in the early years of operation. \nBy limiting the time frame for the oxide to develop \nbetween shedding events, the volume of exfoliation can \nbe controlled to amounts that will be carried out in the \nsteam flow exiting the circuits. Permanent magnets may \nbe used to qualitatively locate the buildup of accumulated \niron oxide exfoliate that might cause blockages in the \nlower bends. RT and eddy current have also been found \nto be beneficial in locating the oxide filled bends.\nWater-cooled  Water-cooled tubes include those of \nthe economizer, boiler (generating) bank and furnace. \nThe convection pass side wall and screen tubes may \nalso be water cooled as discussed in Chapter 19. These \ntubes operate at or below saturation temperature and \nare not subject to significant creep. Modern boilers in \nelectric utilities and many industrial plants operate at \nhigh pressures. Because these boilers are not tolerant \nof water-side deposits, they must be chemically cleaned \nperiodically, which results in some tube material loss. As \ndiscussed in Chapter 43, proper water chemistry control \nwill limit tube inside surface material loss due to ongoing \noperations and cleaning.\nWith the exception of creep deformation, the factors \nthat reduce steam-cooled tube life can also act upon \nwater-cooled tubes. Erosion is most likely to occur on tube \noutside surfaces in the boiler or economizer bank from \nsootblowing or ash particle impingement. Corrosion of \nthe water-cooled tubes is most common on internal tube \nsurfaces and results from excessive water-side deposits. \nDeposit accumulations promote corrosion, caustic gouging \nor hydrogen damage. As deep staging of combustion air \nhas become more common, along with greater variation \nof fuel sources, the potential for wall tube corrosion due \nto the combustion process has increased in some boilers. \nAdditionally, as the use of water for waterwall slag \nremoval has increased, there is greater potential for tube \nwall cracking from thermal cycling.\nRisers  The riser tubes are generally found in the \npenthouse or over the roof of the boiler. They carry \nthe saturated steam-water mixture exiting the upper \nwaterwall headers to the steam drum. In the early years \nof operation these tubes are not subject to significant \ndeterioration. However, as noted with other waterwall \ntubes, as boilers age the riser circuits must be addressed \nin the condition assessment program. A particular con­\ncern is damage from corrosion fatigue. (See Chapter 43.) \nMost recently, problems associated with graphitization \nof carbon-molybdenum tubes or pipes used in the riser \ncircuits of certain utility boilers have posed a hazard and \nshould be targeted for inspection.\nFailures in some water-cooled tubes associated with \ncorrosion fatigue, as well as long-term out-of-service \ncorrosion and graphitization, have occurred outside \nthe boiler settings. Reducing the risk of these failures \noutside the boiler setting is given top priority in an \nassessment program due to the extreme safety hazard \npresented to plant personnel. Condition assessment of the \nwater-cooled tubes should include extensive use of UTT \nmeasurements. Depending on age and the likelihood of \nlong-term corrosion and fatigue, access must be made to \ntubes not normally tested including risers and external \nsurfaces of waterwall tubes. When access is available, it is \nadvantageous to perform internal visual inspection with \na fiber optic or video probe. Special attention should be \ngiven to tube bends. Material sampling is recommended \nfor units constructed with carbon-molybdenum riser \ntubes or pipes to determine if graphitization is present.\nHeaders\nHeaders and their associated problems can be grouped \naccording to operating temperature. High temperature \nsteam-carrying headers are a major concern because they \nhave a finite creep life and their replacement cost is high. \nLower temperature water- and steam-cooled headers are \nnot susceptible to creep, but may be damaged by corrosion, \nerosion or severe thermal stresses.\nHigh temperature  The high temperature headers are \nthe superheater and reheater outlets that operate at a bulk \ntemperature of 900F (482C) or higher. Headers operating \nat high temperature experience creep under normal condi­\ntions. The mechanics of creep crack initiation and crack \ngrowth are further discussed in the data analysis section \nof this chapter. Fig. 5 illustrates the locations where crack­\ning is most likely to occur on high temperature headers. \nIn addition to material degradation resulting from creep, \nhigh temperature headers can experience thermal and \nmechanical fatigue. Creep stresses in combination with \nthermal fatigue stress lead to failure much sooner than \nthose resulting from creep alone.\nThere are three factors influencing creep fatigue in su­\nperheater high temperature headers: combustion, steam \nflow and boiler load. Heat distribution within the boiler \nis not uniform; burner inputs can vary, air distribution \nis not uniform, and slagging and fouling can occur. The \nnet effect of these combustion parameters is variations in \nheat input to individual superheater and reheater tubes. \nWhen combined with steam flow differences between \ntubes within a bank, significant variations in steam \ntemperature entering the header can occur. (See Fig. 6.) \nChanges in boiler load further aggravate the temperature \ndifference between the individual tube legs and the bulk \nheader. As boiler load increases, the firing rate must \nFig. 5  Header locations susceptible to cracking.\n", "char_count": 6226, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_46", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Condition Assessment", "is_complete_section": true}}

During this transient, \nthe boiler is temporarily over fired to compensate for the \nincreasing steam flow and decreasing pressure. During \nload decreases, the firing rate decreases slightly faster \nthan steam flow in the superheater with a resulting \ndecrease in tube outlet temperature relative to that of \nthe bulk header. (See Fig. 7.) As a consequence of these \ntemperature gradients, the header experiences localized \nthermal stresses much greater than those associated with \nsteam pressure and can result in large ligament cracks \nas shown in Fig. 8.\nIn addition to the effects of temperature variations, \nthe external stresses associated with header expansion \nand piping loads must be evaluated. Headers on boilers \nthat cycle frequently may experience fatigue cracks at \nsupport attachments, torque plates, and tube stub-to-\nheader welds. Steam piping flexibility problems can cause \nexcessive loads to be transmitted to the header outlet \nnozzle. These stresses may result in externally initiated \ncracks at the outlet nozzle to header saddle weld.\nCondition assessment of high temperature headers \nshould include a combination of NDE techniques that \nare targeted at the welds where cracks are most likely to \ndevelop. Creep of the header may cause measurable swell; \nthe diameter can be measured at several locations on the \nheader and the outlet nozzle to monitor for signs of creep. \nHowever, swell measurements are better applied to high \ntemperature piping where temperatures are uniform.

This test is the most effective to \ndetermine if ligament cracking has occurred. Locations \nselected should correspond to the hottest location along \nthe header as determined by thermocouple data or NOTIS \ntesting.\nLow temperature  The low temperature headers \nare those operating at temperatures below which creep \nis a consideration. These include waterwall headers, \neconomizer inlet and outlet headers, and superheater \ninlet and intermediate headers. Any damage to the low \ntemperature headers is generally caused by corrosion, \nerosion or fatigue.\nWaterwall headers in electric utility and industrial \npower generation boilers are most often located outside \nthe hostile environment of the combustion zone. One \nexception is the economizer inlet header; this may be in \nthe gas stream and is subject to unique problems associ­\nated with cycling. Boilers that are held overnight in a hot \nstandby condition without firing can experience severe \ndamage to the economizer inlet header in a very short \ntime. This damage is typically caused by thermal shock. \nThe magnitude of the thermal shock to the economizer \ninlet is a function of the temperature differential between \nthe feedwater and the header. It is also a function of \nfeedwater flow rate. The thermal shock is most severe \nnear the header feedwater inlet and rapidly decreases \nas flow passes into the header and tubes. Economizer \ninlet headers have also been found to experience flow \naccelerated corrosion (FAC) or erosion-corrosion near \nfeedwater inlets with excessive wall loss in some tubing.\nThe primary concern with other low temperature \nheaders is internal and external corrosion during out-of-\nservice periods. Lower waterwall headers on stoker-fired \nboilers that burn coal or refuse may experience erosion \nalong the side walls adjacent to the stoker grates. \nAssessment should include thorough visual inspection \nalong with internal inspections using video probes or \nfiber optics. Any areas suspected of thinning or wall loss \nshould be checked with UTT.\nAttemperators\nThe attemperator, or desuperheater, is located in \nthe piping of the superheater and is used for steam \ntemperature control. (See Chapter 19.) The spray at­\ntemperator is the most common type used. (See Fig. 9.) \nIn the spray unit, high quality water is sprayed directly \ninto the superheated steam flow where it vaporizes to cool \nthe steam. The attemperator is typically located in the \npiping between the primary superheater outlet header and \nthe secondary superheater inlet header. Steam exiting \nthe primary header at temperatures of 800 to 900F (427 \nto 482C) enters the attemperator, where relatively cool \nwater [approximately 300F (149C)] is sprayed into the \nsteam and reduces the temperature to the inlet of the \nsecondary superheater. Because of the large temperature \ndifference between the steam and spray water, parts of \nthe attemperator experience thermal shock each time it \nis used. Over a period of years this can lead to thermal \nfatigue and eventual failure. (See Fig. 10.)\nCondition assessment of the attemperator requires \nremoval of the spray nozzle assembly. The thermal \nstresses occurring in the attemperator are most damag­\ning at welds, which act as stress concentrators. The spray \nhead and welds on the nozzle assembly are examined \nvisually and by PT to ensure there are no cracks. With \nthe spray head removed, the liner can be examined with \na video or fiber optic probe. For larger attemperators, it \nmay be necessary to remove radiograph plugs upstream \nand downstream of the attemperator to better view the \ncritical liner welds.\nHigh temperature piping\nDamage mechanisms  Damage to high temperature \npiping systems operating at more than 800F (427C) \narises from creep, cycle fatigue, creep fatigue and \nerosion-corrosion.\nMost modern high temperature piping systems \nare designed for temperatures ranging from 950 to \n1050F (510 to 566C), or higher. The American Society \nof Mechanical Engineers (ASME) allowable material \nstresses at these temperatures may produce creep rupture \nin approximately 30 to 40 years. Systems designed from \n1950 through 1965, that used 1-1/4 Cr-1/2 Mo alloy steel \n(SA-335P11/SA-213T11), may be considered underde­\nsigned by today’s standards because the ASME Code has \nevolved, lowering the allowable high temperature design \nstress for this material.\nFatigue damage to a piping system is caused by \nrepeated cyclic loading, which can be the result of \nmechanical loads, thermal expansion and contraction, \nand vibration. Most piping systems are designed with \nsome degree of fatigue resistance. This built-in flexibility \ncomes from hangers and supports.\nCreep and fatigue can occur together and interact to \ncause more damage than each mechanism by itself. This \ncombination of conditions is by far the most prominent \nbecause most power piping systems are highly dynamic. \nIn addition, depending upon the piping design, stresses, \ntemperatures and manufacturing process, damage \nassociated with creep and/or creep fatigue can result in \ndifferent damage mechanisms. The deterioration can \nbe seen as development and growth of cracks, either \nsubsurface or surface breaking, or damage may occur \nas accumulated creep cavitation along welds. Experience \nin the electric utility industry has also shown that the \nhigh temperature (also referred to as high energy) piping \nof the main steam and hot reheat system must be given \nprominent attention in the plant’s condition assessment \nprogram. Any failure or leak in a piping system releases \nsteam into the plant and is a safety hazard for plant \npersonnel. This is of particular concern with longitudinal \nseam weld piping common in reheat systems where \nFig. 9  Typical attemperator assembly.\n", "char_count": 5858, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_46", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Condition Assessment", "is_complete_section": true}}
{"chunk_id": "unit_001_page_011", "page_number": 11, "text": "46-11\nSteam 42 / Condition Assessment\nThe Babcock & Wilcox Company\nfailures have a greater potential to be catastrophic.\nErosion-corrosion is not as prominent as the creep \nfatigue failure mechanisms. It is defined as wall thinning \nthat is flow induced and occurs on the fluid side of the pip­\ning system. Factors that contribute to erosion-corrosion \ninclude bulk fluid velocity, material composition and fluid \npercent moisture.\nOverall evaluation program  When evaluating high \ntemperature piping, condition assessment planning is \ninfluenced by the following conditions: piping operates \nabove 1000F (538C); was manufactured of SA-335P11 \nor P22 material, or manufactured of long seam welded \nmaterial; has been used in cycling service; has had hanger \nproblems; was manufactured with specific weld joint \ntypes; has a history of steam leaks; or operates above \ndesign conditions. Once a priority list is developed, the \nevaluation can begin. This evaluation program should \nbe as complete as possible.\nDetailed evaluation program \nPhase 1  To determine where physical testing is \nrequired, the following preliminary steps are part of a \nPhase 1 evaluation: plant personnel interviews, plant \nhistory review, walkdowns, stress analysis, and life \nfraction analysis.\nPlant personnel interviews are conducted to gather \ninformation that is not readily available from plant \nrecords. Significant history may only be found in recol­\nlections of experienced personnel.\nOperating history reviews complement personnel \ninterviews. They can provide problem histories and design \nor operating solutions.\nPiping system walkdowns, both during operation \nand following cool down, serve three major functions: to \nevaluate pipe supports and hangers, to find major bending \nor warping, and to verify changes.\nPipe hangers and supports should be carefully exam­\nined. This can be done by creating a baseline inspection \nrecord of all supports.\nWhile the data are being taken during the piping \nwalkdown, the general appearance should also be noted. \nIn particular, inspections may reveal the following dam­\nages: necked-down rods or yokes, spring coil fractures, \ndeterioration of the hanger can, and deterioration of \ntiebacks into building steel.\nMany times a walkdown reveals that a modification \nwas performed. If the entire system was not reviewed \nduring the modification, other problems may result.\nStress analysis of the piping system can be performed \nafter the steps outlined above are completed. Typically, a \ncomputer program is used to perform the stress calcula­\ntions based on the design and any abnormal conditions \nfound during the walkdown. Once a piping system is \nmodeled, the analysis allows the engineer to pinpoint \nhigh stress locations. The objective is to focus the \nnondestructive examination work on these high stress \nareas according to priority.\nLife fraction analysis (LFA) of a pipe is performed \nif the primary failure mode is creep due to operating \ntemperatures above 900F (482C). The LFA is based \non the unit’s operating history and stress levels, and is \ncalculated using design conditions and minimum wall \nthicknesses. This analysis is discussed at length later.\nPhase 2  Phase 2 of the evaluation includes all \nphysical testing of the piping system. The majority of \nthe testing should be nondestructive; however, some \ndestructive testing may be required. The results from \nPhase 1 testing provide test location priority. Specific \ntest recommendations are shown in Table 1.\nThe test data generated from the inspections must be \nevaluated to determine the remaining component life. \nThis is known as the Phase 3 evaluation and is covered \nunder Analysis Techniques.\nTypical failures  The most typical steam pipe failure \nis cracking of attachment welds (support welds or shear \nlugs) or at circumferential welds. These cracks may be \ncaused by thermal fatigue, improper support or improper \nwelding, among others. However, less common failures \nof long seam welds pose the greatest hazard because the \npotential for catastrophic failure is always present.\nThreaded radiograph plugs often have cracked seal \nwelds because the threads can become disengaged over \ntime due to corrosion, creep swelling or oxidation.\nSteam pipe warping is another serious problem.

The high strain between the upper and \nlower sections of pipe can cause permanent deformation \nand lead to weld failures.\nTwo other common failure areas in the high tem­\nperature piping system are the boiler outlet headers and \nturbine stop (throttle) valves. These areas should always \nbe considered in any piping evaluation.\nLow temperature piping\nDamage in low temperature piping operating at less \nthan 800F (427C) is not typically caused by creep. These \nsystems typically fail due to fatigue, erosion or corrosion. \nThe evaluation methods are the same as those for high \ntemperature piping; however, a finite life is not predicted. \nLow temperature pipes, if maintained, last much longer \nthan their high temperature counterparts. Typical sys­\ntems are reheat inlet (cold reheat) steam lines, extraction \nlines, feedwater lines and general service water lines.\nTypical failures  Many high temperature failure \nmodes occur in low temperature pipes. Cold reheat lines \nexperience thermal shock because the reheat temperature \ncontrol is typically an in-line attemperator. The attem­\nperator spray can shock the line if the liner is damaged \nor the nozzle is broken. Economizer discharge lines \nthat run from the economizer outlet header to the boiler \ndrum can be damaged during startup sequences. If the \neconomizer is generating steam and flow is initiated as a \nwater slug, the line can experience severe shocks. This can \ncause line distortion and cracking at the end connections \nand support brackets. Other low temperature piping \ncan be damaged by oxygen pitting caused by inadequate \nwater treatment. Erosion due to flow cavitation around \nintrusion points can cause severe wall thinning. If solid \nparticles are entrained in the fluid, erosion of pipe elbows \nresults. General corrosion of the inside pipe surface can be \ncaused by extended outage periods. Proper line draining \nis recommended unless protective materials are in place.\nFeedwater piping  A problem associated with some \nfeedwater piping (and economizer discharge piping) is \nflow accelerated corrosion. FAC of feedwater piping can \noccur for certain combinations of environmental conditions \nand design factors. FAC is associated with carbon steel \npipe material, flow conditions and water chemistry. FAC \nresults in the loss of the protective oxide on internal pipe \nsurfaces and localized dissolution of iron from pipe into the \nflowing feedwater. FAC can lead to wall thinning over a \nrelatively large area of the pipe and can result in eventual \ncatastrophic failure. Because the release of feedwater \ninto the plant poses a severe hazard to personnel, this \npiping system must be addressed in the plant assessment \nprogram. NDE includes internal visual examination and \nmapping of key locations by UTT measurement.\nTubular air heaters\nTubular air heaters are heat exchangers that transfer \nheat from the boiler flue gas to the incoming combustion \nair, as discussed in Chapter 20. On large utility boilers, \ntubular air heaters can contain up to 90,000 tubes with \nlengths of 50 ft (15.2 m) each. These 2 in. (50.8 mm) OD \ntubes are densely grouped with spacings of 3 to 6 in. (76.2 \nto 152.4 mm) centers in two directions. Flue gas flow \ndirection is typically opposite that of the combustion air to \nmaximize thermal efficiency. However, a byproduct of this \ndesign optimization is corrosion on the gas-side cold end.\nFlue gas condensate formation promotes acid corrosion \nwhich causes wall thinning. If left unchecked for several \nyears the tubes eventually corrode through, causing air \nleakage from the air to gas side.\nBecause access to air heater tubes is limited, eddy \ncurrent and acoustic technologies are used to test for \nblockage, holes and wall thinning. Eddy current technol­\nogy is used to measure wall thicknesses of thin [< 0.065 in. \n(< 1.65 mm)] nonferrous heat exchanger tubing. Holes and \npartial and complete blockage are located using acoustic \ntechnology. When an audible sound is introduced into a \ntube it travels the length of the tube and exits the open \nend. If a hole exists in the tube, however, it changes the \nsignal pitch in the same manner as a flutist changes a \nnote pitch. In a like manner, partial or total tube blockage \nyields a pitch change. B&W uses The Acoustic Ranger® \ninspection probe for this test. (See Fig. 11.)\nBoiler settings\nNonpressure boiler components are general mainte­\nnance items and usually are not considered a significant \nfactor in determining remaining life of the unit. The \nnonpressure components include the penthouse, boiler \ncasing, brickwork and refractories, and flues and ducts. \nDeterioration of these components results from mechani­\ncal and thermal fatigue, overheat, erosion and corrosion. \nIn all cases, condition assessment is done by performing \na detailed visual inspection. For flues, ducts and casing, \nit is of value to inspect the in-service boiler to detect hot \nspots, air leaks and flue gas leaks that can indicate a \nfailed seal. Thermal imaging cameras can be used to \nhelp pinpoint areas of greatest heat loss.\nThe structural members of the boiler must be reviewed \nduring a condition assessment inspection. Normally these \nmembers, along with the support rods above the boiler and \nauxiliaries, last the life of the boiler. However, because \nnonuniform expansion can lead to boiler load movement, \nthe support system should be examined during the boiler \noutage inspections. Particular attention should be given \nto header and drum supports that could be damaged if \nthe vessel is distorted.\nAnalysis Techniques\nOnce the testing is complete and the data are compiled, \nFig. 11  Acoustic Ranger® schematic.\n", "char_count": 5823, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_46", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Condition Assessment", "is_complete_section": true}}

In addition, it only provides a gross estimate of \nexpected life.\nStress calculation  The calculation of stresses for \nheaders is complex because of tube stub geometry, tube \nbank loading, differential tube temperatures, and piping \nstresses on the outlet nozzle. Using specially developed \nsoftware codes, it is possible to perform a finite element \nanalysis for the entire header. B&W has performed \nfinite element analysis on the tube stub ligament region \nand found that this area contains very high stresses, \nespecially during temperature transients.\nThe total stress (St) applied to the flaw is equal to the \nsum of the primary stresses (axial or hoop) (Sp), bending \nstresses (Sb) and pressure stresses on the crack face (Sc):\n\t\n\t\n(17)\nThe primary stress is determined by the orientation \nof the flaw. If the flaw is located axially along the length \nof the component, then the hoop stress is primary. If \nit is located circumferentially, then the axial stress is \nprimary. Bending stresses are caused by dead loads, \nhanger spacing, thermal differentials and restraints. \nThe pressure stresses applied to the crack face are only \nconsidered when the crack is open to the pressure. When \nthis is the case, the applied stress is equal to the internal \npressure.\nBLESS Code analysis  BLESS is an acronym for \nBoiler Life Evaluation and Simulation System. The \ncomplete BLESS Code considers crack initiation and \ngrowth in headers as well as crack growth in pipes. \nThe BLESS Code can also perform leak before break \nanalysis (LBBA) of axial cracks in pipes. The Code was \ndeveloped for EPRI by B&W as a subcontractor to General \nAtomics. The BLESS Code was derived from B&W’s \nprevious software codes for failure analysis (PCFAD) \nand crack growth analysis (PC CREEP). Because stress \ncalculations in headers and piping require difficult \nfinite analysis due to complex geometries, simplifying \nassumptions were made in the development of the BLESS \nCode to allow for analysis.\nThe BLESS Code greatly facilitates the life assess­\nment of elevated temperature headers and piping by \nLFE =\n+\n=\n=\n∑\n∑\nt\nt\nc\nC\ni\nmi\nj\nj\nj\nx\ni\nz\n1\n1\nS\nS\nS\nS\nt\np\nb\nc\n=\n+\n+\neliminating the need for finite element thermal and \nstress analysis and utilizing developments in nonlinear \ncreep fatigue crack growth. The evaluation includes both \ncrack initiation and crack growth. The Code permits the \nevaluation of the effects of extremely detailed thermal \nand mechanical load histories on headers with very \ncomplicated geometric details. The estimated remaining \nlife is calculated by BLESS either as a single value \n(when re-run in the deterministic mode) or a statistical \ndistribution. This distribution is obtained when BLESS is \nrun in the probabilistic mode and defines the probability \nof failure as a function of time. Such information can be \nuseful in making run/repair/replace and re-inspection \ndecisions for aging or cracked headers and piping.\nFlaw characterization  Flaws found in headers and \npiping must be characterized prior to crack growth, \nLBBA or BLESS analysis. This characterization involves \naccurately determining the flaw’s length and depth. \nThrough-wall depth is considered the most critical. The \nmost common characterization methods include standard \nNDE techniques such as MT, PT, RT and UT, including \nadvanced techniques such as phased array and TOFD.\nDestructive samples\nDestructive sampling is frequently done when data \nfrom nondestructive evaluations are inconclusive. Mate­\nrial properties, damage and deposits can be quantified. \nTube samples and boat samples are discussed earlier \nunder Destructive examinations.\nLeak detection\nLeaks in boilers, piping and feedwater heaters are \nmajor contributors to power plant unavailability and \nperformance losses. In their early stages, leaks are often \nundetected because they are inaudible and/or concealed \nby insulation.\nIn the early 1980s, acoustic monitoring equipment \nwas first used in the boiler industry for leak detection. \nBy using a piezoelectric pressure transducer to detect \nacoustic energy emitted by a leak, the detection of smaller \nleaks became possible. Leak noise is transmitted by air \nand by the structure. Boiler tube leaks are most often \ndetected through airborne sensors because of the large \nboiler structure volume. Feedwater heaters, headers and \npiping leaks are best detected by use of structural sensors.\nLeak noise is caused by a fluctuating pressure field \nassociated with turbulence in the fluid. Turbulence is a \ncondition of flow instability in which the inertial effects \nare highly dominant over the viscous drag effects. Once \nturbulence is established, the acoustic energy radiated \nfrom a leak increases strongly with pressure and flow \nrates.\nAcoustic leak detection technology has been dem­\nonstrated through laboratory work, field testing and \noperational experience. The sensitivity of the sensor \ndepends on three factors: sound radiated from the leak, \nattenuation of sound between the leak and the sensor, \nand background noise. Leak noise occurs in a broad band, \nranging from below 1 kHz to above 20 kHz. Because \nof the low frequency background noise and the greater \nattenuation of high frequencies, most airborne systems \noperate in the range of 1 to 25 kHz.

Therefore, in designing \na system, there is a tradeoff between sensor spacing and \nminimum detectable leak.\nTable 2 shows typical leak monitor signals for boiler \ntubes, feedwater heaters, steam piping, and crack detec­\ntion acoustic emissions.7\nCycling Effects and Solutions\nIn assessing a boiler’s ability to withstand cycling, \nthose components most vulnerable to cycling are \nreviewed first. These components are discussed from \ntwo standpoints: the operating methods which minimize \ncyclic damage, and design modifications which permit \nthe component to better withstand cycling conditions.\nCycle definition\nTwo types of cycling service are usually considered: \nload cycling and on/off cycling. The on/off type has also \nbeen called two shifting.\nA cycle is considered to start at full load, full tem­\nperature steady-state conditions. It goes through a load \nchange, then returns to the initial conditions. A typical \nload cycle is then composed of three phases:\n1.\t load reduction,\n2.\t low load operation, and\n3.\t reload.\nA typical on/off cycle has four phases:\n1.\t load reduction,\n2.\t idle,\n3.\t restart, and\n4.\t reload.\nThe phase that is often ignored, the idle period, can \noffer the greatest potential for reducing cyclic damage.\nEconomizer thermal shock\nOn boilers that are on/off cycled, economizers often \nshow more cyclic damage than other components. The \neconomizer receives water from the extraction feedwater \nheater system, and the inner metal surface temperature \nfollows the feedwater temperature with practically no \ntime delay. As a result, high rates of metal temperature \nchange can occur with high local stresses.\nFig. 15 shows economizer inlet temperatures during \nan overnight shutdown cycle. The first two hours are for \nload reduction, followed by eight hours of idle or banked \ncondition. Next, the boiler is fired in preparation for \nrestart. The rates of temperature change during the load \ndecrease and increase are usually not excessive, but would \nrepresent load cycling conditions for the economizer.\nDuring the banked period, there is some air leakage \nthrough the boiler with a resulting decay in boiler pres­\nsure. As this happens, the drum water level decreases. \nAt the same time, the leaking air passing through the \nboiler is heated to near saturation temperature, and \nthat air then heats the economizer. An economizer \nmetal temperature can increase at 30 to 50F/h (17 to \n28C/h) during this period and can approach saturation \ntemperatures. When the drum level drops, the operator \nusually refills the boiler so that it is ready for firing. \nBecause there is no extraction steam available, the \nfeedwater temperature is low. This slug of cold water \nquickly chills the economizer, causing thermal shock as \nindicated by the solid lines in Fig. 15. The inlet header \nand tubes receive the greatest shock.\nWhen the boiler is fired in preparation for turbine \nrestart, rollup and synchronization, the economizer \nheats up rapidly, often nearing saturation temperature. \nFeedwater is started when the initial load is applied to \nthe turbine. Because little extraction heating is available, \nfeedwater temperature is low. A severe shock occurs at \nthis point, as the temperature can increase 300F (167C) \nin a few minutes.\nTypically, early damage consists of cracks initiating \nin the tube holes of the inlet header which are closest to \nthe feedwater inlet connection. (See Fig. 16.)\nOther damage has also been seen from this cyclic \nservice. Outlet headers have shown damage similar to \ninlet headers. Furthermore, some tube bank support \nsystems cannot accommodate the high temperature \ndifferences between rows.\nSolutions are available to reduce the frequency and \nmagnitude of thermal shocks. These have taken two forms \nand address the out-of-service and restart conditions.\nThe first solution is called trickle feed cooling. Very \nsmall quantities of feedwater are frequently introduced \nduring the shutdown and restart periods. This prevents \nthe inlet header from reheating and reduces the cooling \n", "char_count": 4150, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_005", "section_id": "chapter_17", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "∑", "is_complete_section": true}}

Because feedwater \nintroduction is controlled to limit economizer temperature \nrise, some drum blowdown may be necessary to prevent \na high water level.\nA second method of reducing thermal shock is to permit \nthe economizer to reheat during the idle period and then \nto provide higher temperature feedwater for restart. This \ncan occur by pressurizing a high pressure heater with \nsteam from an auxiliary source or from the drum of the \nunit. The quantity of steam required is low because it \nonly heats the initial low flow of feedwater.\nFurnace subcooling\nDrum boilers that have been subjected to on/off cycling \nhave also been found to develop multiple cracks in lower \nfurnace wall tubes where the tubes are restrained from \ndiameter expansion or contraction. Typical cracking \nareas have been at the lower windbox attachment where \nfiller bars or plates are welded to the tubes. (See Fig. 17.)\nInvestigation of these failures indicated that, during \nthe shutdown or idle period, relatively cold (cooled below \nsaturation temperature) water settled in the lowest \ncircuits of the furnace bottom. When circulation was \nstarted by initial firing or the circulating pump, the cold \nwater interface moved upward through the walls, rapidly \ncooling the tubes. As the interface moved, its temperature \ngradient decreased and the rate of cooling decreased, \ntherefore reducing damage higher in the furnace. Experi­\nence indicates that if the subcooling can be limited to 100F \n(56C), there is a low probability of damage.\nAn out-of-service circulating pump system may be \nused to limit the subcooling. (See Fig. 18.) This is a \nlow capacity pump that draws from the bottom of the \ndowncomers and discharges water to the drum, therefore \npreventing the stratification temperatures of water \nwithin the unit.\nCorrosion fatigue\nAs noted previously, the impact of on/off cycling \nFig. 15  Economizer temperatures during overnight shutdown cycles.\nFig. 16  Cracking in economizer inlet header occurs first in bore holes \nnearest water inlet.\nFig. 17  Lower windbox attachment cracking due to subcooling.\n", "char_count": 2199, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_005", "section_id": "chapter_17", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "∑", "is_complete_section": true}}

Owners must be particularly alert to damage \nin circuits that are outside the boiler enclosure and \npose greater safety hazards in the event of failure. (See \nChapter 43.)\nTube leg flexibility\nThe enclosure walls of most boilers are water- or \nsteam-cooled. The water-cooled circuits carry boiling \nwater, and the steam-cooled circuits carry steam from the \ndrum. As a result, they operate near the saturation tem­\nperature corresponding to the drum pressure. Whether \nthe boiler is being fired or shut down, considerable heat \nabsorption or loss is necessary to change the temperature \nof the walls. As a result, they change temperature more \nslowly than the other components.\nThe economizer, superheater and reheaters penetrate \nthese walls; the penetrations are designed to be gas-tight. \nAt the point of penetration the expansion then follows \nsaturation temperature. However, the header that forms \nthe inlet or outlet of the other circuits expands with the \ntemperature of the steam or water that it is handling. \nFig. 19 shows the motions of the header end and the \noutermost connecting leg for a superheater or reheater \noutlet. Note that the greatest deflection is when the \nheader temperature is at a maximum.\nIn the case of economizers and the reheater inlet, \nthe deflection is in the opposite direction because these \nheaders operate below saturation temperature. For these \ncomponents the greatest temperature difference, and \ntherefore the greatest deflection, is at low loads.\nRegardless of the direction, the greatest temperature \ndifference produces the maximum differential expansion \nand the maximum bending stresses in the connecting \nlegs. The stress range and amplitude dictate component \nfatigue life.\nThe first indications of cyclic damage are external \ncracks on the tube-to-header welds or the stub-to-tube \nwelds of the outermost header legs. This damage is \nrelatively easy to inspect and repair. Successive damage is \nalso usually limited to closely adjacent legs because they \nhave experienced similar stress levels. Most sensitive \nare high temperature headers located at relatively short \ndistances from the penetration seal on large units. On \nthese large boilers, the headers are long which, when \ncoupled with short outlet tube legs, will produce the \ngreatest bending stresses at the header welds.\nDrums\nThe cycling of utility drum boilers has the potential \nto produce significant variation in drum temperatures. \nThe drum is a large thick-walled vessel that inherently \nresponds slowly to temperature changes. Top to bottom \nvariations in drum temperature can lead to drum \nhumping (Fig. 20), excessive stresses on connections, and \nfatigue in welds. Any areas of significant temperature \nvariations, including nozzle penetrations, have the \npotential to produce excessive thermal stresses and drum \ndamage over time, given enough cycles.
