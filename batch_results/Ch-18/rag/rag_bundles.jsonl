In \naddition, they are distinguished by whether they operate \nat atmospheric or elevated pressure, whether they are air \nor oxygen blown, and whether coal is fed dry or as a slurry.\nAtmospheric or pressurized\nGasifiers are designed to operate at pressures from \natmospheric to as high as 900 psia (6.2 MPa). Pressurized \ngasifiers are generally better suited for applications \nwhere the product syngas will be burned in a gas turbine \nfor power generation or used in a process that requires \nhigh pressure. Atmospheric gasifers are often used to \nproduce syngas for chemical process such as fertilizers, \nor the syngas can be compressed for other uses. However, \nproducing the syngas at a higher pressure is more chemi­\ncally effective and the lower volumetric flow allows for \nmore compact, less costly, and more efficient syngas \ncleanup processes.\nAir or oxygen blown\nThe oxidant for a gasifier can be provided by either \nair or oxygen. Oxygen-blown gasifiers are fed nearly pure \noxygen or oxygen-enriched air. The nearly pure oxygen \nis supplied by a cryogenic ASU. Oxygen-blown gasifiers \ngenerally operate at higher pressures and temperatures \nthan air-blown processes. The added cost and power \nconsumption for the ASU must be offset by the economy \nof scale and the smaller components that result from \nhigh pressure operation and the elimination of nitrogen \nfrom the process.\nAir-blown gasification does not require an ASU, but \nthe air must be compressed to the process pressure and \nthe nitrogen dilutes the syngas by a factor of about 3 \nresulting in a lower calorific value syngas than oxygen-\nblown gasifiers. Air-blown systems operate at lower \npressures and, since air is the oxidant, temperatures are \nalso lower due to nitrogen dilution. Since there is greater \ngas volume due to the nitrogen in the air, the components \nare larger compared to oxygen-blown processes of the \nsame output. Air-blown gasifiers are also less efficient \nprimarily due to the heat loss associated with the nitrogen \nthat comes with the air.\nDry or slurry feed\nCoal is fed into a pressurized gasifier either as a dry \nsolid or a coal-water slurry. Dry feed generally uses \neither dilute or dense phase pneumatic conveying and \nis a more efficient feed process. Slurry feed systems \ncost less, but the energy needed to vaporize the water \nreduces the cold gas efficiency, which is the efficiency to \nconvert the coal to syngas. As a result, slurry-fed gasifers \nproduce a syngas higher in CO2 than dry-fed processes. \nAlthough not detrimental to downstream combustion, \nthis can negatively impact solvent-based acid gas removal \nprocesses.\nGas flow\nUp-flow (countercurrent)  The oldest and simplest \ntype of gasifier is the up-flow (countercurrent) gasifier \nshown in Fig. 7a and 7b. The oxidant enters at the bot­\ntom of the gasifier vessel and the gas leaves at the top \n(up-flow), while the fuel flows in the opposite direction \n(countercurrent) of the gas. The combustion reactions \noccur near the grate at the bottom of the vessel, followed \nby reduction reactions somewhat higher up in the gasifier. \nIn the upper part of the gasifier, heating and pyrolysis of \nthe feedstock occur as a result of heat transfer by forced \nconvection and radiation from the lower zones. The tars \nand volatiles produced during this process remain in the \ngas stream while ash is removed from the bottom.\nThe advantages of up-flow gasifiers are: 1) simplicity, \n2) fuel flexibility, 3) high cold gas efficiency, and 4) high \nchar burnout and internal heat exchange leading to low \ngas exit temperatures. Major drawbacks are: 1) potential \nfor channeling that can lead to oxygen breakthrough \nTable 2\nGasifier Comparison\n \nParameter \nFixed (Moving) Bed \nFluidized Bed \nEntrained Flow \nTransport\nGas flow \nUp-flow  \nUp-flow  \nUp-flow or down-flow  \nUp-flow\n  \n (countercurrent) \n (countercurrent) \n (counter or co-current) \n (countercurrent)\nFuel size \nCoarse < 2 in.

The product gas and ash or slag are removed \nat the bottom of the vessel. This solves the problem \nof tar entrainment in the gas stream. The down-flow \nconfiguration is shown in Fig. 7c. Depending upon where \nthe oxidant is introduced (below the coal feed or with the \ncoal feed as shown), there may be some or no (plug-flow) \nmixing of the gas with the particles. \nAs the gas flows downward, the acid and tar distil­\nlation products from the fuel pass through the bed of \nburning char where they are converted to hydrogen, \ncarbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and methane gases. The \nefficiency of this conversion depends on the temperature \nand residence time. \nThe advantage of down-flow gasifiers is the potential \nto produce tar-free gas. However, it is very difficult to \nachieve this goal over the entire operating range and \nturndown ratios of 3:1 are common; 5:1 to 6:1 is considered \nexcellent.

The gasification process \ninvolves a series of countercurrent reactions. At the top, \nthe coal is heated and dried while cooling the product \ngas. The coal is further heated and devolatilized as it \ndescends through the carbonization zone. Below this \narea, the devolatilized coal is gasified by reaction with \nsteam and CO2. The highest temperatures are reached \nin the combustion zone near the bottom of the gasifier. \nThe char-steam reaction, together with the presence of \nexcess steam, keeps the temperature in the combustion \nzone below the ash slagging temperature.\nA fixed-bed gasifier has the following characteristics:\n1.\t produces hydrocarbon liquids such as tars and oils,\n2.\t has limited ability to handle fine particles,\n3.\t requires special steps to handle caking coals,\n4.\t produces relatively high gas methane content, and\n5.\t has low oxidant requirements.\nThe main differences among these gasifiers are the \nash conditions (dry or slagging) and design provisions for \nhandling fines, caking coals and hydrocarbon liquids.\nThe configuration of the moving-bed dry ash gasifier \nis shown in Fig. 8. It is a high pressure cylindrical unit, \noperating at 350 to 450 psig (2410 to 3100 kPa). The \nmain gasifier shell is surrounded by a cooling water \njacket. Coal enters the top through a lock hopper and \nmoves down the bed under the control of a rotating \ngrate. The temperature in the combustion zone near the \nbottom is about 2000F (1093C), whereas the gas leaving \nthe drying and devolatilization zone near the top is \napproximately 1000F (538C). This moving-bed process is \ncapacity limited. Almost all of these units have a diameter \nof 13.1 ft (4 m) and a nominal dry gas capacity rating of \n33,333 SCFM (14.9 Nm3/s). This is equivalent to about \n650 t/d (590 tm/d) of MAF (moisture- and ash-free) coal. \nFluidized bed  In a fluidized-bed gasifier (Fig. 7b), \nthe oxidant flows upward through the feed coal particles \nat a sufficient velocity relative to the particle size that, \nalthough a discrete bed level exists, the particles are \nsuspended or fluidized by the gas flow, producing \ngood mixing and constant motion. The fluidized bed is \nmaintained below the ash fusion temperature to avoid \nclinkers which could cause defluidization. (A clinker \nis a large solid mass of coal ash agglomerated by ash \nslagging.) Char particles entrained with the hot, raw gas \nare recovered and recycled to the gasifier. Fluidized-bed \ngasifiers are always up-flow.\nA fluidized-bed gasifier has these characteristics:\n1.\t has large char recycle,\n2.\t requires special steps to obtain high carbon conversion \nof high rank coals,\n3.\t requires special steps to handle caking coals,\n4.\t features uniform and moderate temperature, and\n5.\t requires moderate oxygen and steam inputs.\nThe main differences among fluidized-bed gasifiers \nare the ash conditions (dry or agglomerated) and design \nprovisions for char recycle. An agglomerated fluidized bed \ncontains a hot zone where the ash particles are caused to \ncluster into small pellets prior to removal. Agglomerated \nash operation enables the gasification of high rank coals. \nDry ash fluidized-bed gasifiers operate most efficiently \non low rank coals.\nThe fluidized-bed gasifier was the first commercial \ncoal gasification unit and was the initial application \nof fluidized-bed technology. The first of these gasifiers \nwas the Winkler design put into operation in Leuna, \nGermany, in 1926.\nEntrained flow  In an entrained-flow gasifier (Fig. \n7c), fine coal particles are fed with the oxidant in such \na way that they are suspended, or almost sprayed, \nconcurrently into the process and mixed in a similar \nfashion to a pulverized coal burner. The fine pulverized \ncoal particles react with steam and oxidant with very \nshort residence time. They can be up-flow (usually slurry \nfed), or down-flow.\nAn entrained-flow gasifier has these characteristics:\n1.\t gasifies all coals regardless of rank, caking charac­\nteristics or amount of fines,\n2.\t requires substantial heat recovery due to the large \namount of sensible heat in the raw gas,\n3.\t operates at a high temperature slagging condition,\n4.\t has a large oxidant requirement, and\n5.\t requires special steps to avoid molten slag carryover \nto downstream heat recovery surfaces.\nFig. 8  Moving-bed dry ash gasifier (courtesy of Dravo Corporation).\n", "char_count": 4624, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_003", "section_id": "chapter_6", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Gasifier Types and Applications", "is_complete_section": true}}

This unit is also called a suspension \ngasifier because it consists of a two-phase system of \nfinely divided solids dispersed in a gas. No distinct bed \nlevel exists.\nThe entrained-flow technology began as an atmo­\nspheric pressure process for producing synthesis or fuel \ngas from solid or liquid carbonaceous fuels. The original \nbench-scale development of this gasifier type was done \nby Dr. Friedrich Totzek in the late 1930s while working \nfor Heinrich Koppers GmbH of Essen, Germany. The \nprocess was jointly piloted in the U.S. by H. Koppers \nGmbH; Koppers Company, Inc. of Pittsburgh; and the \nU.S. Bureau of Mines. The first commercial entrained-\nflow gasification plant was built in France in 1949. The \nprimary application is hydrogen production for ammonia \nsynthesis.\nFig. 9 shows the entrained-flow atmospheric pressure \ngasifier. The coal is pulverized and fed by screw conveyors \nthrough opposing burners into a horizontal, elliptically \nshaped gasifier. The fuel is oxidized, producing a flame \nzone temperature of about 3500F (1927C). Heat losses \nand endothermic reactions reduce the gas temperature \nto about 2700F (1482C). The hot product gas is further \ncooled by direct water quenching to about 1700F (927C) \nto solidify entrained liquid slag particles before they enter \nthe heat recovery (waste heat) boiler.\nThe cold gas efficiency of the original Koppers-Totzek \noxygen-blown gasifier was 67%. Although this appears \nto be low, an additional portion of the coal’s energy was \nconverted into heat which was recovered by the cooling \njacket and heat recovery boiler. Combining these energy \nsources yielded an overall efficiency of 85%. More recent \nimprovements in modern entrained-flow gasification \nsystems can increase the total efficiency into the high \n90% range. Most gasifiers use a design featuring two \nopposing burners. These have a total capacity of 10,583 \nSCFM (4.73 Nm3/s), which is equivalent to about 230 \nt/d (209 tm/d) of MAF coal. Two plants with four-headed \ndesigns have about twice this capacity each. \nTransport \nA transport gasifier is a circulating \nfluidized-bed gasifier in which the oxidant flows upward \nthrough the feed coal particles at a velocity high enough \nthat no discrete bed level exists. The particles are fully \nsuspended and highly fluidized by the gas flow, producing \nexcellent mixing. As with the fluidized bed, the process \nis maintained below the ash fusion temperature to avoid \nclinkers which could cause defluidization. Due to the \ndegree of mixing, the circulating loop inherent in the \ndesign, and particle size, char burnout is excellent. This \ntype of gasifier, initially developed by MW Kellogg, has \nbeen tested at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) \nNational Carbon Capture Center near Wilsonville, \nAlabama. (See Fig. 10.)\nA transport gasifier has the following characteristics:\n1.\t offers high carbon conversion (>95%),\n2.\t provides cold gas efficiency of 70 to 75%,\n3.\t can handle a broad range of coals,\nFig. 10  U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) National Carbon Cap­\nture Center.\nFig. 9  Entrained-flow gasifier (courtesy of Dravo Corporation).\n", "char_count": 3380, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_003", "section_id": "chapter_6", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Gasifier Types and Applications", "is_complete_section": true}}

In the 1980s and early 1990s, \nat least eight plants were built for power generation, \nfour of which were in the U.S. However, beyond these \ndemonstrations, commercialization has been limited.\n Production of power from gasifying coal and combust­\ning the product gas in a combined cycle power plant \nrequires a high degree of component integration, as shown \nin Fig. 11. In simple terms, fuel gas is combusted in a gas \nturbine to drive the air compressor and generator, with \nsome of the compressed air used to gasify the coal. The \nbyproducts, such as char, are often burned in secondary \nprocesses to produce additional steam and/or power. \nThe gas turbine exhaust, hotter than 1000F (538C) with \nmodern machines, passes through a heat recovery steam \ngenerator (HRSG) to produce superheated steam to drive \na steam turbine-generator (see Chapter 27) comprising \na combined cycle. The gasification process releases \nsignificant thermal energy which is also recovered into \nthe steam cycle to maximize overall plant efficiency.\nThe design of an IGCC system is quite complex, with \nmany factors to consider to achieve the right balance of \ncapital cost, plant efficiency, operability, and emissions \nperformance for a given application. For example, the \nchoice of gasifier type affects the amount of fuel gas heat \nrecovery duty.\nAn oxygen-blown, entrained-flow gasifier with its high \noperating temperature requires more raw gas cooling to \nachieve a high efficiency cycle design. The gas coolers \nmust operate in a harsh environment and are a critical \ncomponent in plant reliability. Integrating the large \nquantity of low level steam energy (limited by metal \ntemperatures) into the steam cycle tends to complicate \nplant control and operation. In contrast, cooling the \nraw gas by quenching eliminates the capital cost and \ncomplexity of heat recovery, but at a substantial efficiency \npenalty (as much as 10% less efficient than with total \nheat recovery).\nOxygen plant integration is another design issue. \nFig. 11 shows the turbine-driven air compressor directly \nfeeding the oxygen plant, which produces oxygen more ef­\nficiently by reducing external compression requirements. \nHowever, this imposes more demand on turbine controls \ndue to the large system volume between the compressor \nand turbine.\nOther technical factors, such as fuel characteristics, \ninfluence process design. A high inherent moisture fuel \nsuch as lignite may not be a good candidate for a coal-water \nslurry-fed gasifier due to reduced efficiency. Gas turbine \noperation, emissions, and compressor performance can \nvary widely when handling the larger variance between \nair flow and gas flow when firing high volume, low Btu \ncoal gas. Ambient temperatures and utility load demand \ncharacteristics add to the list of design considerations.\nPlant size is typically set by the size of the gas \nturbine. A single gas turbine/steam turbine installation \ncan produce more than 600 MW, with about 60% of the \npower coming from the gas turbine. Larger plants require \nmultiple gas turbines. Economies of scale can be  realized \nby utilizing a single steam turbine fed by multiple gas \nturbines, and in larger balance-of-plant systems such as \nfuel handling, ASUs, electrical and controls, and water \ntreatment systems.\nConcerns about climate change have inspired a \nresurgence of interest in IGCC with capture and storage \nor utilization of the CO2. Comparisons of carbon capture \ntechnologies currently predict similar performance and \nlevelized cost of electricity for the three major CO2 capture \noptions: IGCC, post-combustion and oxy-combustion. With \nfederal assistance, efforts are underway to demonstrate \nall three capture technologies as well as storage methods \nto better understand the true performance and costs. \nChapter 36 provides information on carbon capture and \nutilization or storage (CCUS) technologies, focusing on \npost-combustion and oxy-combustion, and their current \nstate of development and demonstration.\nWhen CO2 capture is integrated into IGCC, additional \nequipment is required. The CO2 must be separated from \nthe flue gas and compressed for use or underground \nstorage. This is typically accomplished at pressures of 300 \nto 400 psi (2.1 to 2.8 MPa) by one of two processes that \nstrip the CO2 using a regenerable solvent. Amine-based \nsolvents react chemically to capture the CO2. Physical \nsolvents absorb the CO2 gases rather than reacting \nchemically with them.\nWith renewed interest in hydrogen production, a \nFig. 11  Integrated coal gasification combined cycle schematic.\n", "char_count": 4994, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_003", "section_id": "chapter_6", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Gasifier Types and Applications", "is_complete_section": true}}

With partial combustion, only a fraction \nof the carbon in the coal is completely oxidized to CO2. \nThe heat released provides the energy necessary to break \nchemical bonds in the coal and raise the products to the \nreaction temperature.\nAlthough the chemistry of coal gasification is complex, \nthe following are the major reactions involved:\nExothermic reactions—releasing heat\n\t\nCarbon combustion:\t\nC + O2  =  CO2  (1)\n\t\n\t\nC + 1 / 2  O2  =  CO  (2)\n\t\nWater-gas shift:\t\nCO + H2O  =  CO2 + H2  (3)\n\t\nMethanation:\t\nCO + 3H2  =  CH4 + H2O  (4)\n\t\nDirect methanation:\t\nC + 2H2  =  CH4  (5)\nEndothermic reactions—absorbing heat\n\t\nBoudouard reaction:\t\nC + CO2  =  2CO  (6)\n\t\nSteam-carbon reaction:\t C + H2O  =  H2 + CO  (7)\n\t\nHydrogen liberation:\t 2H (in coal)  =  H2 (gas)  (8)\nOperating variables, such as fuel composition, operat­\ning pressure, and steam and oxygen inputs influence \nthe final gas composition. Gasifiers are designed for \npressures ranging from atmospheric to 600 psi (4137 kPa) \nand higher. The methanation reactions are important \nin low temperature, high pressure systems as shown in \nFig. 6.4 The other reactions are more prominent in high \ntemperature, low pressure systems. The combination of \nthese reactions is autothermic, meaning sufficient heat \nis initially released by the carbon combustion reactions \nto provide energy for the endothermic reactions.\nSulfur in coal is converted primarily to hydrogen sul­\nfide (H2S) and a small amount of carbonyl sulfide (COS). \nHigh temperatures and low pressures favor coal nitrogen \nconversion to N2, while the opposite conditions favor \nsome ammonia (NH3) formation and small amounts of \nhydrogen cyanide (HCN). In lower temperature processes \n[<1200F (<649C)], tars, oils and phenols are not destroyed \nand therefore exit with the raw gas. Many other minor \nimpurities are produced depending on their presence in \nthe raw fuel. These include chlorides, vaporous alkali \nspecies and heavy metals. Heavy hydrocarbons are also \nproduced in lower temperature gasifier processes.\nThe gasification reactions occur in two main stages: \ndevolatilization and char gasification. Devolatilization \nis a transition stage in which coal becomes char, or fixed \ncarbon, as the temperature rises. Weaker chemical bonds \nare broken and tars, oils, phenols and hydrocarbon gases \nare formed. The char that remains after devolatilization \nis gasified by reaction with oxygen, steam, carbon dioxide \nand hydrogen.\nThe type of gasification process has a strong bearing \non the devolatilization products. In fixed-bed or moving-\nbed gasifiers, these products exit the gasifier with the \nproduced gas due to the low temperatures and lack of \noxygen. In fluidized-bed and entrained-flow gasifiers, \nuniform high temperature and the availability of oxygen \ncauses hydrocarbon cracking, or breaking down the \nmore complex molecules to simpler ones, producing H2, \nCO and CO2. These reactions are most complete in an \nentrained-flow process.\nThe basic objective of gasification is to convert coal \ninto a combustible gas containing the maximum heating \nvalue. If the produced gas is used for chemical synthesis \nrather than fuel for combustion, its composition must be \nadjusted for the stoichiometry of the synthesized product. \nHydrogen for syngas production must be provided by the \nsteam-carbon reaction or by the water-gas shift. The \nrequirements of the end product may affect the choice of \ngasification process. The water-gas shift reaction can be \npromoted by supplying extra steam in the fuel bed or in \na separate catalytic conversion stage downstream. This \nproduces increased hydrogen. Where hydrogen is the only \nproduct required, CO2, which is an inevitable product of \nsplitting water by reaction with carbon, must be removed. \nLimestone may also be injected along with the coal and/\nor steam to capture sulfur.\nIn the case of synthetic natural gas (SNG) production \nwith low temperature, high pressure moving-bed pro­\ncesses, much of the methane can be produced in the fuel \nbed by carbon hydrogenation (Reaction 5). However, all of \nthe methane cannot be produced by direct hydrogenation. \nSome must be produced indirectly in a separate catalytic \nstage, e.g., by Reaction 4.\nOxygen for the gasification process can be supplied \neither in pure form (oxygen-blown) or in air (air-blown). \nThere are advantages and disadvantages to both methods. \nOxygen-blown gasification results in smaller components, \nhigher cold gas efficiency and purer gas composition, \nbut requires an air separation unit (ASU) for oxygen \nFig. 6  Methane formation with pressure.4\n", "char_count": 4821, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_002", "section_id": "chapter_4", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Basic Gasification Reactions", "is_complete_section": true}}

It was used for this purpose until the late \nnineteenth century when the abundance of natural gas \nand conventional oil supplanted its use. During World \nWar II in Germany, coal was used to derive liquid fuels \nfor military use. Little advancement of the technology \noccurred until the oil crisis of the 1970s revived interest \nin commercializing gasification as a means of producing \nsynthetic fuels and chemical feedstocks. This was espe­\ncially true in the U.S. which has the largest coal reserves \nin the world. A subsequent decline in oil prices led to a \nreduced interest in gasification until the mid-1980s when \nenvironmental drivers drew attention to gasification \nas a potentially cleaner and more economical means \nof electricity production from coal. Several large-scale \ndemonstration projects were built during that period in \nthe U.S., Europe and Asia, but advancements in conven­\ntional technologies, such as pulverized coal-fired steam \nsystems, proved gasification for power generation to be \nuneconomical. Since the late 1990s interest has again \nrevived due to concerns about climate change and the \npotential for gasification processes to more economically \nand efficiently produce electricity with very low emissions \nwhile capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) for storage or use. \nAlthough these economic and performance objectives \nhave yet to be realized, projects are being funded to build \nthe next generation of coal-based gasification plants \nfor power generation which incorporate some degree of \ncarbon capture.\nB&W Background\nThe Babcock & Wilcox Company (B&W) has been \ninvolved in gasification processes since the mid-twentieth \ncentury. The first gasifier designed and constructed by \nB&W (Fig. 1) was put into operation in 1951 at the U.S. \nBureau of Mines at Morgantown, West Virginia (currently \nthe U.S. Department of Energy’s National Energy and \nTechnology Laboratory). Operating at atmospheric \npressure, this unit was oxygen-blown and was capable of \ngasifying 500 lb/h (0.063 kg/s) of coal, producing about \n330,000 ft3/d (8850.6 Nm3/d) of synthesis gas (syngas). \nIt was refractory lined and was comprised of a primary \nand secondary reaction zone. The primary zone produced \ntemperatures exceeding 3000F (1649C) and the second­\nary zone operated at about 2200F (1204C). The unit was \noperated successfully for more than 1200 hours.\nB&W also assisted the U.S. Bureau of Mines in its \nearly pressurized gasification studies. One unit designed \nby B&W featured a down-fired axial coal feed [500 lb/h \n(0.063 kg/s)] with tangential steam and oxygen feeds. \nThis unit was designed for operation at 450 psig (3100 \nkPa). It was operated during the 1950s and 1960s and \nwas occasionally used in the 1980s.\nA reduced-scale gasifier was constructed at Belle, \nWest Virginia, in 1951.1 This unit was rated at 3000 \nlb/h (0.38 kg/s) of coal and produced 1389 SCFM (0.62 \nNm3/s) of synthesis gas. When installed, it was the largest \npulverized coal gasifier in the U.S. The unit operated for \nFig. 1  Early B&W oxygen-blown gasifier, circa 1951.\n", "char_count": 3339, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_18", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Coal Gasification", "is_complete_section": true}}

The unit was 15 ft (4.6 m) in diameter \nand 88 ft (26.8 m) tall. It was designed to gasify 17 t/h \n(15.4 tm/h) of coal, producing 17,360 SCFM (7.75 Nm3/s) \nof carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The gasification zone \nwas refractory lined and the floor and walls were water \ncooled. The gasifier operated for more than a year, then \nshut down when low cost natural gas became available.\nIn the early 1960s, another pilot unit was constructed \nby B&W at its research facility in Alliance, Ohio (Fig. 2). \nThis air-blown unit was used in a cooperative program \nwith General Electric to study combined gas turbine/\nsteam turbine cycles. It consisted of a 3 t/h (2.7 tm/h) \ngasifier with char recycle, mechanical gas cleanup \nequipment, and a gas-cooled cyclone combustor. This \nfacility was operated for three years beginning in 1960, \nand horizontal and vertical slag-tap, vortex-fired gasifiers \nwere studied.\nB&W also built a 5 t/h (4.5 tm/h), 1500 psig (10,340 \nkPa) gasifier for the bi-gas pilot plant at Homer City, \nPennsylvania (Figs. 3 and 4). This plant, which opened \nin 1976, demonstrated the production of synthetic natural \ngas from coal. The project was sponsored by the Office of \nCoal Research, the U.S. Department of Interior, and the \nAmerican Gas Association.\nAs the firing and operation of an entrained-flow \ngasifier (see Entrained-flow gasifier section later in this \nchapter) are somewhat similar to that of a pulverized \ncoal-fired boiler,2,3 all of B&W’s gasification processes are \nentrained-flow gasification systems featuring pulverized \ncoal feed. A pressurized 850 to 1000 t/d (771 to 907 tm/d) \ngasifier design with a waste heat recovery boiler is shown \nin Fig. 5.\nThe gas-tight membrane wall enclosure provides an \nannular space which separates the gasification reactor \nand the pressure vessel. Therefore, the pressure vessel, \nat a relatively low temperature, is not in contact with the \ncorrosive raw gas. In the lower portion of the unit (the \ngasification zone), the tubes are studded and covered with \nrefractory to maintain the high temperatures necessary \nto keep the slag fluid. In the upper portion of the gasifier \n(the freeboard zone), the tubes are exposed to provide \nmaximum cooling. This construction has proven its \ndurability in Cyclone wet bottom boilers.

Temperature in the combustion zone is \nabout 3400F (1871C) and the gas leaving the unit is at \n1800F (982C).\nWhat is Gasification\nCoal gasification is a process that converts coal from \na solid to a gaseous fuel through partial oxidation. Once \nthe fuel is in the gaseous state, undesirable substances, \nsuch as sulfur compounds and coal ash, may be removed \nfrom the gas by various techniques to produce a clean, \ntransportable gaseous energy source.\nWhen coal is burned, its potential chemical energy \nis released in the form of heat. Oxygen from the air \ncombines with the carbon and hydrogen in the coal to \nproduce gaseous CO2 and water plus thermal energy. \nUnder normal conditions, when there is sufficient oxygen \navailable, nearly all of the chemical energy in the coal is \nconverted into heat and the process is called combustion.\nHowever, if the available oxygen is reduced, less \nenergy is released from the coal and gaseous reaction \nproducts appear from the incomplete combustion. These \nbyproducts, including hydrogen (H2), carbon monoxide \n(CO) and methane (CH4), contain chemical energy which \ncan be used to power a gas turbine, to use as fuel gas \nin fuel cells, or as a substitute for natural gas. If the \nobjective is to maximize the chemical energy in the gas \nbyproducts, it would appear logical to continue decreasing \nthe available oxygen. However, a point is reached where \nan increasing percentage of the carbon in the coal remains \nunreacted, and less is converted to gas, rendering the \nprocess inefficient. When the oxygen supply is controlled \nsuch that both heat and a new gaseous fuel are produced \nas the coal is consumed, the process is called gasification.\nBy recovering waste heat from a gasifier and gas \nturbine exhaust, a gas turbine (Brayton) cycle and steam \nturbine (Rankine) cycle can be efficiently combined into \nan integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC). This \napproach to power generation from coal has been dem­\nonstrated but not widely applied commercially because \nconventional combustion systems remain less costly and \nFig. 4  Bi-gas gasifier prepared for shipment.\nFig. 5  Typical 1000 t/d entrained-flow design.\nless complicated.

This reaction involves introducing water into \nthe coal gas which reacts with the methane and CO to \nform CO2 and hydrogen. The CO2 can be separated and \ncompressed for utilization or storage and the hydrogen \ncan be fired in a specially designed gas turbine. While \nthis process is under development at small scale, it has \nnot been demonstrated at the scale envisioned for power \ngeneration.\nCoal to Liquids\nCoal gasification has yet to realize widespread use \nin utility power generation applications. Considering \nU.S. energy security issues, gasification may be more \nbeneficial in converting coal to liquids (CTL). There are \ntwo fundamental ways to accomplish this: direct and \nindirect liquefaction.\nDirect liquefaction (Fig. 12a) employs a solvent at high \ntemperature and pressure to create a chemical reaction. \nHydrogen gas and a catalyst are used to produce a low-\nquality liquid fuel. It is generally more costly to produce \na liquid fuel that meets U.S. purity standards with direct \nliquefaction so it is not considered the method of choice.\nIndirect liquefaction first gasifies coal to produce a \nsynthetic gas. The syngas is then converted to a liquid \nfuel using one of two methods: the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) \nprocess (Fig. 12b) or the Mobil process (Fig. 12c). The \nFig. 12  Coal liquefaction process schematics.\nMobil process converts the syngas to methanol and then \nto gasoline by dehydration and is the less common of the \ntwo methods.\nThe FT process was developed in the 1920s by two \nGerman chemists, Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch. This \nprocess cleanses the syngas of impurities and refines the \nproduct into sulfur-free diesel fuel or gasoline. Either \ncoal alone or in combination with biomass can be used \nto synthesize the gas with the same process. The basic \nchemical reactions for the FT process are:\n  \t\n\t\n(10)\n  \t\n\t\n(11)\nThe FT process was employed by Germany during \nWorld War II due to its lack of a domestic supply of crude \noil. Sasol in South Africa has been producing coal-derived \nliquid fuels since 1955 (Fig. 12d). Due to the high cost \nof conversion, commercial CTL use has primarily been \nlimited to South Africa where it is heavily subsidized by \nthe government. Additional development efforts took place \nduring the oil crisis of the 1970s, but the present cost of \nproducing CTL fuels is not yet economical compared to \nconventional petroleum products.\nIn addition to being more energy intensive, indirect \nliquefaction using gasification with the FT process \n3C + 4H2O → 2CO + 4H2 + CO2\n2CO + 4H2 → 2(-CH2−) + 2H2O\n", "char_count": 2755, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_004", "section_id": "chapter_11", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Coal to Liquids", "is_complete_section": true}}
