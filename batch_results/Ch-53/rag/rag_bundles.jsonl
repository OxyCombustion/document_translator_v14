The overall goal of \nan integrated nuclear waste management program is \nto immobilize and isolate the nuclear material from the \necosystem until it no longer poses a significant threat to \nthe environment.\nAs discussed in Chapter 48, one option for disposal \nis to reprocess the used or spent fuel bundles to recover \nuranium and plutonium for further use and to concentrate \nthe highly radioactive products of the fission process plus \ntransuranium elements into a smaller volume of waste. \nThe other option is to dispose of the spent fuel without \nreprocessing (referred to as the once-through cycle). In \neither case, the disposal of such high level waste (HLW) \nrequires the safe, undisturbed confinement of material \nfor hundreds of years. Other waste materials with lower \nlevels of residual radioactivity must also be handled and \nstored appropriately.\nA key factor of the proper disposal of spent fuel is the \nprevention of contact between radioactive material and \nground water because such contact could allow for the con­\ntaminated material to spread easily into the environment.\nThe nuclear waste management system includes \ntemporary on-site storage immediately after use in the \nreactor, transportation, long-term storage, processing \ninto an alternate form, and ultimate long-term disposal.\nAt the start of the nuclear age in the 1940s through \nthe 1960s, high level waste from reprocessing was stored \nin tanks for later disposal. Commercial reactor fuel, \nlike defense reactor fuel, was to be reprocessed and the \nresultant small volume of waste was to be stored until a \ndisposal technique was chosen.\nSince the early 1970s, waste storage regulations \nhave become progressively more rigorous in response \nto environmental concerns. The nuclear industry has \nresponded to this trend by significantly reducing the \namount of waste produced while ensuring safe storage \nof the remaining material.\nThe products classified as nuclear waste range from \nslightly contaminated disposable clothing to highly \nradioactive recyclable fuel byproducts. The methods \nused to treat and manage the different forms of waste \nvary widely.\nNuclear Waste Definitions and Descriptions \nThere are four common categories of nuclear waste: \nhigh level, transuranic, mill tailings and low level.\nChapter 53\nNuclear Waste Management\nHigh level waste \nHigh level waste (HLW) is the byproduct of the repro­\ncessing of spent nuclear reactor fuel which has undergone \nsignificant irradiation. HLW contains virtually all of the \nfission products and most of the transuranium elements \nproduced by the fission process. (See Chapters 48 and \n49.) If spent nuclear fuel is not reprocessed, the spent \nfuel elements are also treated as HLW.\nHigh level waste from reprocessing usually takes the \nform of a viscous liquid after concentration by evaporation. \nIt is initially stored as an aqueous nitric acid solution \nin high integrity stainless steel tanks until its initially \nhigh activity level and resulting heat generation decline.\nTypical plans call for the permanent storage of this \nwaste as a solid. In one option, the viscous liquid is mixed \nwith borosilicate glass, melted, and then solidified inside \nstainless steel canisters in a process called vitrification. \nThis process immobilizes the radioactive material in a \nstable mass which is highly resistant to leaching of the \nradioactive material if it ever comes in contact with water. \nThe solid mass is still highly radioactive and requires \nshielding and careful handling. Radiation from HLW \ndeclines with time, with the general radioactivity drop­\nping to a level comparable to naturally occurring uranium \nore in less than 1000 years. In addition, the waste must \nbe isolated from the biosphere for many years. HLW heat \ngeneration must also be handled in storage facilities. \nCertain waste resulting from the reprocessing of spent \nnuclear fuel can also be classified as waste incidental to \nreprocessing rather than HLW, with similar handling \nand storage options.\nAlthough less radioactive than HLW, greater than \nClass C (GTCC) materials are usually considered as \nHLW. These materials have been subjected to significant \nneutron irradiation and their residual radiation levels \nare relatively high. Reactor components that contain \nsignificant amounts of cobalt, if subjected to an extremely \nhigh neutron field, generate enough gamma rays to be \nclassified as GTCC. Examples include stainless steel \ncore control assembly components and fuel end fittings. \nMost metals, such as the Zircaloy fuel rod cladding, can \nwithstand a large radiation field without becoming a \nradiation source. GTCC waste produces little heat, but \nit must be shielded for transport or storage.\nTransuranic waste \nTransuranic (TRU) refers to atoms of man-made \nelements containing isotopes with atomic weights \n", "char_count": 5058, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_53", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Nuclear Waste Management", "is_complete_section": true}}

These wastes are \nthe byproducts of weapons production, plutonium, or \nmixed oxide fuel production or fuel reprocessing. The \nmost common element is plutonium.\nTransuranic waste, by definition, has a half life \ngreater than 20 years and a total activity exceeding 100 \nnanocuries (nCi) per gram of material; it generates little \nheat. Before 1970, these materials were classified as low \nlevel wastes and were treated accordingly. TRU waste \nis now considered in three categories and each requires \na different level of treatment and disposal. Contact-\nhandled TRU (CH-TRU) waste has a surface dose less \nthan 200 millirem per hour (mR/h), remote-handled \nTRU (RH-TRU) waste has a surface dose greater than \n200 mR/h, and special TRU (SP-TRU) waste is a large \ncontaminated piece of equipment. Nearly all TRU waste \nis the contact-handled type.\nMill tailings \nMill tailings are the byproducts from mining and \nprocessing uranium ore. They contain elements such as \nthorium and radium that are byproducts of natural U-238 \ndecay. The tailings are generally piped to a disposal pit \nas sludge where they dry into a pile. Although there is \nno heat generation and the radiation generated by these \npiles is insignificant, the material must be stabilized \nto prevent migration into water supplies or airborne \ncontamination. An additional concern is the generation \nof radon gas caused by the radium decay. This gas can \nbe carried by the wind and can deposit in lung tissues in \na harmful manner.\nLow level waste \nLow level waste (LLW) is any waste with a self-\ngenerated radiation field that does not fall into one of the \nprevious categories and has less than 10 nCi per gram of \ntransuranium contaminants and low concentrations of \nradioactive materials. This waste can range from reactor \ncomponents to home fire alarms. LLW is categorized \nas Class A, B or C, or below regulatory concern (BRC), \naccording to United States (U.S.) federal regulations. LLW \ncan come from defense, nuclear power or industrial sources.\nDefense and nuclear power low level waste is typically \ngenerated by one of two methods: either activation or \nfission product migration. Activation occurs when \nmaterials are exposed to a neutron radiation field. \nThese materials may 1) remain in a large component \nsuch as a pressure vessel, 2) break down as corrosion \nproducts and be deposited on other surfaces, or 3) exist \nas surface/water impurities that migrate to other areas. \nTritium generation from boron in reactor cooling water \nis an example of activation. Fission product migration \ncan result from small quantities of radiation escaping \nfrom fuel rod leaks or from uranium contamination on \nthe outside of the rods. Fission products can be gaseous, \nsoluble in water, or solid fragments capable of water or \nair migration.\nMost defense or power LLW can be grouped either as \nprotective materials, bulk waste, or liquid derivatives. \nProtective materials include anti-contamination clothing \nand other sealing, cleaning and wrapping agents. Bulk \nwaste encompasses dirt, concrete, metal components or \ndebris. Liquid derivatives include ion exchange resins \nused for coolant purification, evaporator concentrates, \nsteam generator cleaning solutions, and sludges from \ncontaminated oil recovery.\nInstitutional wastes come from research organiza­\ntions, universities, laboratories, medical facilities, \nhospitals and medical schools. They include solid wastes \n(glass, metal and plastic), biological wastes (tissue) and \nchemical wastes (scintillation detector fluids and barium).\nIndustrial LLWs are generated by fabricators of smoke \ndetectors, pacemakers and airport lighting systems. They \ncan also be byproducts of processes such as oil drilling and \nfood sterilization. Pharmaceutical companies and nuclear \nfuel fabrication plants are additional sources of LLW.\nBecause the radiation levels in BRC materials are \nextremely low, these materials can be disposed of with no \nspecific regard for their radioactivity. Class A wastes are \nmore strictly regulated. They must be stored in leakproof \nnoncardboard containers; liquids must be solidified or \nmixed with an absorbent. Class A wastes must contain \nno explosive or spontaneously combustible materials and \npressure from gases must be minimal.\nClass B LLW must meet all Class A requirements, but \nmust also be stabilized, i.e., its container must keep its \nsize and shape in the presence of moisture, emplacement \noverburden, or radiation during its disposal life. Class C \nLLW must meet Class A and Class B requirements and \nmust be packaged and disposed of to prevent inadvertent \nintrusion after the disposal site is closed. This is usually \naccomplished by layering the waste, placing the Class C \nmaterial in the bottom layers.\nMixed waste \nA waste stream that combines LLW with non-nuclear \nhazardous material is called mixed waste. Although this \nform of waste is common and regulated in Europe, it is \nprohibited in the U.S. Domestic LLW is regulated by \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), whereas \nhazardous waste is controlled by the Environmental \nProtection Agency (EPA). Control of existing mixed waste \nis shared by these agencies on a case-by-case basis.\nAlso in the U.S., mixed waste is further divided into \nthree principal types. Low level mixed waste is primarily \nthe result of research and weapons production. High level \nmixed waste results from spent fuel reprocessing and ir­\nradiated targets from reactors. Mixed transuranic waste \nresults from weapons manufacturing, plutonium-bearing \nfuel fabrication, and spent fuel reprocessing.\nNuclear Waste Storage \nWaste storage is a prime concern in nuclear power \ngeneration. Early nuclear plant sites were designed to \nuse closed fuel cycles. As such, storage pools for spent fuel \nwere only designed to have the capacity for storing a frac­\ntion of the plant’s lifetime fuel supply and the intent was \nto ship the spent fuel to a reprocessing facility to reclaim \nfuel components. The resultant waste stream would be \nsmall and could be stored for long-term radioactive decay \nbefore disposal.\nJust as large reprocessing plants at Morris, Illinois, \nand Barnwell, South Carolina, were being brought on line, \ngovernment regulations in the 1970s effectively banned \nthe recycling of nuclear wastes in the U.S. Although the \nreprocessing moratorium was rescinded in the 1980s, \n", "char_count": 6501, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_53", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Nuclear Waste Management", "is_complete_section": true}}
{"chunk_id": "unit_001_page_003", "page_number": 3, "text": "53-3\nSteam 42 / Nuclear Waste Management\nThe Babcock & Wilcox Company\nlittle commercial recycling occurred in the U.S. due to \nthe large capital losses sustained in the 1970s. However, \nongoing reprocessing programs are underway in countries \nsuch as France, the United Kingdom (U.K.), Russia and \nJapan.\nNuclear plants in the U.S. consequently had to \ndetermine other ways of handling the radioactive \nspent fuel assemblies. Options included expanding the \ncapacity of existing storage pools, shipping the waste \nto an off-site storage location, and creating new on-site \nstorage facilities.\nEarly storage pools could hold only two to three times \nthe amount of fuel needed to fill the core. The large \nspacing between fuel assemblies prevented inadvertent \ncriticality and their capacity would have been sufficient \nif the fuel were reprocessed. New storage pool designs \nof the late 1970s used high density racks which relied \non neutron absorber materials rather than geometry to \nprevent criticality. As rack designs improved, utilities \nwere successful in re-racking the spent fuel pools until \nmaximum capacity was achieved. Storage capacity at \nDuke Energy Corporation’s Oconee Unit 3 in the U.S., for \nexample, tripled with this improved technology.\nSpent fuel management options \nEven with maximum re-racking, plants can only store \na portion of the spent fuel during the total projected plant \nlife. Several management options have been proposed, \nstudied and applied in demonstration projects that have \nnot materialized as viable solutions. These include double-\ntiered pool storage, rod consolidation, transferal to another \npool facility, and shipment overseas for reprocessing.\nThe double-tiered pool storage concept suggested \nstacking a second level of fuel racks within the spent \nfuel pool. This is not possible in most spent fuel pools \ndue to structural limitations, fuel accessibility, and/or \naccountability concerns.\nRod consolidation is a method of dismantling the fuel \nassemblies where the rods are spaced apart, and then \nre-storing the rods within a container allowing for a \nhigher compaction ratio. While this process was used at \na few plants, it has since been abandoned due to several \ntechnical issues rendering the process more difficult and \ncostly than anticipated.\nThe transfer of spent fuel to a separate wet storage \nfacility has been accomplished in some cases, but the \navailability of wet storage facilities to accept fuel is \nlimited. An example of a successful transfer program is \nthe Shearon Harris plant in the U.S., which has a storage \npool originally designed to service three reactors. Because \nonly one reactor was completed at this location, spent fuel \nassemblies from the owner’s Robinson and Brunswick \nplants have been shipped there. However, this is not a \ntypical situation and such transferal is, therefore, not a \ncommon option for utilities.\nWith respect to shipping fuel outside of the U.S. for \nreprocessing, some countries have indicated an interest \nin recycling U.S. commercial spent fuel. However, legal \nissues and high cost have precluded this option to date.\nThere are two parallel approaches currently being \nused to address spent fuel management in commercial \nnuclear plants. First, the fuel is being used longer during \noperation in the reactor (high burnup), and second, on-site \ndry storage facilities are being built and operated.\nTo decrease storage needs, a high burnup extended \ncycle fuel may be used. Early pressurized water reactor \n(PWR) fuel featured 3% uranium-235 enrichments and \nwas irradiated for three one-year cycles; a burnup of \n30,000 to 35,000 MWd/tmU was attained. Recent designs \nhave enrichments up to 5% and cycle times have been \nextended up to two years. Certain fuel cycle designs \npermit fuel assemblies to remain in-core for four cycles \nand the resultant burnup has increased well beyond \n45,000 MWd/tmU. The extended burnup results in less \nfuel used and less space required for storage over the life \nof the plant.\nThe most widely used option for interim storage is to \nplace the spent fuel in dry storage casks and remove the \nfuel from inside the plant building to a location on the \nplant property. This method involves the construction \nof an on-site independent spent fuel storage installation \n(ISFSI) where the loaded dry casks reside until their \neventual shipment away from the plant site. All U.S. \nutilities have used or are planning to use this option, \nwhich began in 1986. There are currently 54 licensed \nand operating ISFSI sites (with some serving multiple \nunits) and 11 commercial reactor sites pursuing new \nISFSI licenses.\nThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) committed to \nstart taking spent fuel from utilities in 1998 for interim \nstorage at a monitored retrievable storage (MRS) facility, \nbut this activity failed to materialize by the intended \ndeadline. The DOE and a federal nuclear waste negotiator \ncontinue to solicit volunteer sites to host one or more MRS \nfacilities. When realized, the MRS facilities will accept \nshipments of spent nuclear fuel from commercial power \nplants, will store the fuel temporarily above ground, \nand will eventually deposit the shipments in a geologic \nrepository for permanent disposal.\nStorage container materials \nIn the 1980s, the Virginia Electric Power Company \n(VEPCO), the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) \nand the U.S. DOE jointly reviewed the feasibility of \ndual purpose metal casks (long-term storage followed \nby transport to a disposal site). Although none of \nthose particular designs were able to obtain licensing \ncertification for transport, several were certified for \nstorage. VEPCO’s Surry plant pioneered the use of these \nmetal casks for storing spent nuclear material. Since \nthen, several metal casks have been licensed for dual \npurpose; however, their use for storage is economically \nunfavorable. \nCurrently, the most common dry storage technolo­\ngies in the U.S. employ a canister system that can be \ninterchangeably placed into either a storage overpack \nor a transportable cask. The spent fuel is loaded into \nthe canister, which is a thin-walled steel vessel that is \ndewatered (completely dry), backfilled with an inert gas, \nand welded shut providing a containment boundary. \nThe canister is transported with a transfer cask to a \nstorage overpack module, which is then placed onto an \nISFSI pad. The storage overpack is typically constructed \nof thick concrete to provide adequate shielding, and is \nventilated to facilitate thermal cooling. When the fuel \nis ready for shipment, the canister can be removed from \n", "char_count": 6632, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_53", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Nuclear Waste Management", "is_complete_section": true}}

With the canister system, the \nfuel does not need to go back into the spent fuel pool to \ntransfer from the storage overpack to the transport cask. \nTo date, these systems are used solely for storage and \nare not considered a substitute for permanent disposal.\nIn Canada, Ontario Power Generation (OPG) \ncontracted with Babcock & Wilcox (B&W) Canada \nand another supplier in 2009 to fabricate and supply \ndry storage containers for its CANDU®-design PWR \ngenerating stations. (See Chapter 47.) Each container, \nas illustrated in Fig. 1, holds approximately 460 ft3 \n(13 m3) of concrete, with inner and outer steel sleeves. \nThe approximately 2 ft (0.6 m) thick walls, as well as \nthe concrete closure, provide radiation shielding to \nworkers and the public. Each container is composed \nof a 15 t (13.6 tm) top and 50 t (45.4 tm) base. Through \n2013, approximately 200 of these containers have been \nsupplied to OPG by B&W Canada.\nIn the U.S., B&W Canada manufactured 11 of \nTransnuclear’s NUHOMS®-24P canisters for use at the \nOconee Nuclear Station.\nAs permanent disposal options continue to see \ndelays, the need for long-term dry storage technologies \nhas become more important. It is expected that new \nnuclear plants will be designed for operating lives of up \nto 80 years, and dry storage options will at least equal \nthis time line. ISFSI facilities using the canister-based \nstorage overpack modules appear to be the fuel storage \nsolution for the foreseeable future.\nStorage of other HLW/LLW\nThe U.S. DOE and its predecessor, the Atomic Energy \nCommission (AEC), have been reprocessing spent fuel \nsince the mid-1940s. Byproducts from these efforts have \nbeen stored in tanks located at federal facilities such as \nHanford, Washington; Idaho Falls, Idaho; Oak Ridge, \nTennessee; and Aiken, South Carolina. A vitrification \nplant (see High level waste section) was developed, \nconstructed, operated and decommissioned at the West \nValley Demonstration Project near Buffalo, New York, \nfrom 1983 to 2005. The high level wastes were solidified \ninto 275 stainless steel canisters. Although the canisters \nrelease significant thermal and radiological emissions, \nthe mixtures are stable for transportation and storage. \nA vitrification plant has been operating at the Savannah \nRiver Site Waste Processing Facility in Aiken, South \nCarolina, since 1996. The plan for the largest vitrification \nplant in the world began construction at the Hanford site \nin 2001 and is expected to be operational in 2022.\nMost transuranic wastes are stored in liquid form in \n55 gal (208 l) drums at their point of origin. Because of \ntheir relatively low radioactive emissions, these wastes \nare stored in a secure but not isolated manner.\nStorage of low level waste varies considerably. Most \nsolid waste is wrapped, placed in sealed 55 gal (208 l) \ndrums, and stored in secured areas. Although liquid \nwaste can initially be stored as a liquid, it must be sta­\nbilized or solidified for shipment and disposal. Reduction \nof LLW has been a high priority since the early 1980s. \nReducing this volume has been accomplished by reducing \nits creation, compacting solid waste, and incinerating \ncombustible waste.\nRadioactive Material Transportation \nSubstantial regulations have been developed to \nsafeguard the transportation of nuclear waste material. In \nthe U.S., the Department of Transportation and the NRC \nshare the responsibility for safe transportation. Primary \nregulations include details regarding routing, type of \nvehicle, placarding, carrier regulations, and packaging.\nThe packaging requirements are an evolution of \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency guidelines that \nwere created in the early 1950s. These requirements \nhave three primary goals: 1) to limit the radiation field \nfrom the package (adequate shielding), 2) to contain its \nradioactive contents (confinement), and 3) to prevent \nfissioning of the contents (criticality safety).\nAlthough skilled individuals are chosen to transport \nnuclear waste, the packaging (container) must provide \nultimate protection in the event of an accident. Packaging \nis based on whether the waste is termed normal or special. \nNormal materials are those that can be shipped as a \nsolid, liquid or gas and, if exposed to the atmosphere, do \nnot pose a health threat. Special waste is hazardous if \nleakage occurs. It is usually shipped in a canister that \nprovides additional containment protection in the event \nof an accident.\nThe level of waste radioactivity determines the type \nof shipping container. Certain materials such as smoke \ndetectors and luminous signs have an extremely low level \nof radioactivity. These exempted materials require no \nspecial packaging. Radioactive material defined as low \nspecific activity (LSA), Type A or Type B is contained \nwith unique packaging.\nLow specific activity\nRadioactivity from LSA materials is low enough \nthat inhalation or ingestion of the material presents \nlittle health hazard. Typical LSA materials include mill \ntailings, natural uranium hexafluoride (UF6), laboratory \nmedical wastes, and reactor service tooling. Ion exchange \nresins, although LSA material, must be shipped in \nType A containers because of their susceptibility to \nenvironmental diffusion. LSA packaging must prevent \na release of contents during normal transport conditions, \nbut does not provide shielding. Typical LSA containers \nare wooden boxes, 55 gal (208 l) drums and special tank \ntrailers.\nType A containers\nMaterials with greater than LSA radioactivity require \nType A packaging which provides containment and \nminimal shielding. Type A containers must also be able \nto withstand normal shipping conditions. Most low level \nwastes, as well as institutional and industrial materials, \nare shipped in Type A containers.\nType B containers\nType B packaging requirements are the most stringent \nand cover transport of the most radioactive or fissionable \nmaterial. Type B containers are referred to as casks \nand, in addition to meeting Type A requirements, must \nwithstand severe accident conditions without a breach \nof the container envelope. They provide containment, \nshielding and criticality protection under all conditions. \n", "char_count": 6365, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_53", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Nuclear Waste Management", "is_complete_section": true}}

Type B casks are extremely \nrobust vessels and few manufacturers are certified to \nbuild them.\nMany thousands of commercial spent fuel shipments \nin Type B casks have successfully occurred in the U.S. \nsince the early 1960s. Similar records of shipment and \nsafety also exist in Europe.\nMost existing American spent fuel casks were \ndesigned to ship short-cooled fuel (fuel removed from the \nreactor and stored on location for at least six months). \nNewer casks are being designed to ship longer-cooled \nfuel to federal storage and disposal facilities. Because \nlonger-cooled fuel has lower inherent thermal load and \nradiological source strength, the new casks can have \nlarger payload capacities for a given overall size than \ncasks for short-cooled fuel.\nA special Type B package has also been designed to \ntransport transuranic material. The package is known \nas a transuranic package transporter (TRUPACT). Each \nTRUPACT container holds fourteen 55 gal (208 l) drums. \nThis container transporter system has been further \nimproved through various TRUPACT models.\nNuclear Waste Disposal Systems \nConcern for the environmental impact of nuclear waste \nhas promoted stringent disposal legislation. In addition, \nthe siting, licensing and operation of waste disposal \nfacilities have received increased attention.\nHigh level waste \nIn the U.S., the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) of \n1982 provided guidelines for disposing industrial spent \nfuel and defense high level radioactive wastes. Although \nseparate sites were evaluated, in 1987 the federal govern­\nment decided both types of waste were to be stored in the \nsame repositories.\nA number of disposal options were considered for \nlong-term storage of the waste including geological \nrepositories, an underwater fault line in the sea, under \nthe Antarctic ice, and launching the material into space \ntoward the sun. Geological disposal in an isolated medium \nwas chosen as the best method to prevent subsequent \nnuclide migration in the biosphere. To verify this choice, \nspent fuel assemblies were placed into vertical boreholes \nat the Climax Mine in Nevada. The conditions of the \nfuel and rock were studied for several years and the test \nresults confirmed that this type of repository was safe \nand practical.\nAlso in the 1980s, the EPA and NRC established the \nfollowing repository standards in addition to those placed \non operating nuclear facilities:\n1.\t Any stored spent fuel or high level waste must be \nrecoverable for 50 years after closure of the repository.\n2.\t The waste packages must be leak proof for a minimum \nof 300 to 1000 years.\n3.\t Only phased releases of specific nuclides would be \npermitted for the subsequent 9000 years.\nThe man-made waste package, packing, liners and \nseals are referred to as the repository engineered barrier \nsystem; the geological medium and its characteristics are \ntermed the repository natural barrier system.\nIn response to the 1982 NWPA, the U.S. DOE \nestablished the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste \nManagement (OCRWM) and a federal nuclear waste \nmanagement system. Responsibilities include HLW \ndisposal and repository site search, interim storage and \nits siting, and the transportation system required to \nsupport those sites. The transportation responsibilities \ninclude development of shipping casks and the creation \nof an appropriate infrastructure. Emergency response \nteams, satellite tracking systems and maintenance \nfacilities, which are important public interfaces, are also \npart of this network.\nThe greatest challenge is establishing the media for, \nand locations of, geological repositories. Several geological \nmedia are candidates— rock salt, granite, clay, basalt (a \nglass-like volcanic rock) and tuff (a compacted volcanic \nrock). All of these materials exist in large continuous \ndeposits. Site acceptability criteria include proximity \nto national parks or population centers, the value of \nminerals that cannot be recovered in the repository area, \nand the probability of nuclide migrations. After extensive \ncharacterization studies and, at times, strong debate, \nYucca Mountain in Nevada was selected for investigation \nas the initial nuclear waste repository site by the Nuclear \nWaste Amendments Act of 1987. Tunneling operations \nfor site assessment began in 1994.\nIn 2002, the U.S. Secretary of Energy recommended \nthe Yucca Mountain site to the U.S. president, who agreed \nand notified Congress of the decision. However, the \nGovernor of Nevada vetoed the move, and it was returned \nto Congress. Both Houses of Congress approved moving \nforward, and the Yucca Mountain Siting Resolution \nwas signed into U.S. law on July 23, 2002, officially \ndesignating Yucca Mountain as the nation’s nuclear \nwaste repository site.\nThe following year, as the U.S. DOE continued its \nmandatory license application to the NRC, the project \nwas labeled as over budget and behind schedule. By \n2004, the targeted 2010 opening was in doubt. By 2008, \nproject milestones were being reassessed, due primarily \nto budget shortfalls and restrictions. Project budgets \nwere further reduced in 2009. In 2011, the U.S. president \nannounced an end to government funding. The NRC’s \nlicensing review was therefore suspended.\nThat same Federal Administration established the \nBlue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future \nto review nuclear waste policies and issues, and to \nrecommend a new strategy. The Commission’s final \nreport was issued in January 2012. Recommendations \nincluded a new facility siting process, authorization of \nconsolidated interim storage facilities, and establishment \nof a new waste management organization. The search for \nlong-term solutions in the U.S. continues.\nTransuranic waste \nThe U.S. government has also committed to dispose \nof TRU in a geological repository.

The facility began receiving shipments in 2007, \nand through 2013, the WIPP has received approximately \n12,000 shipments containing over 3.1 × 106 ft3 (89,000 \nm3) of transuranic waste.\nLow level waste \nLow level waste was originally disposed of by the \nAEC at government sites using near-surface burial. \nIn 1963, the first commercial LLW disposal site was \nopened. By 1971, there were six U.S. sites operating: \nBarnwell, South Carolina; Beatty, Nevada; Maxey Flat, \nKentucky; Richland, Washington; Sheffield, Illinois; and \nWest Valley, New York. These sites also featured shallow \nland burial and the facilities met the federal regulations \nat that time.\nShallow land burial was performed by locating reason­\nably dry soil, digging a 15 ft (4.6 m) deep trench, filling \nit with as-received boxes and drums to nearly ground \nlevel, and covering the trench with a 5 ft (1.5 m) thick \ncompacted earthen cap. Ground water monitoring sumps \nwere occasionally used and off-site wells were monitored \nfor nuclide migration. However, these unsophisticated \ndisposal methods were rarely successful. Some sites de­\nveloped leaks and were closed while others have remained \nopen. The active sites now feature improved techniques.\nIn response to these early disposal problems, additional \ngovernment regulations were enacted. These regulations \npermit sites to operate for about 30 years. The sites are \nthen closed and monitored and controlled for the next 100 \nyears. Off-site effluents are prohibited for an additional \n400 years. In 1980, the Low Level Radioactive Waste \nPolicy Act was passed placing responsibility for LLW \ndisposal on generator states and recommended regional \nfacilities. In 1985, this act also required the Barnwell, \nBeatty and Richland sites to remain open through 1992. \nAs of March 2012, three sites remained licensed in \nthe U.S., in the states of Washington, Utah and South \nCarolina, and an additional site was opened in Texas.\nSeveral new techniques that make LLW disposal safer \nfor workers and the public have been developed. Packaging \ndesigns now eliminate voids when stacking materials. All \ncontents are compacted or stabilized, thereby eliminating \nliquids. As a result, the total volume of disposed low level \nwastes per year was cut in half from 2005 through 2011. \nIn addition, all corrosive materials are stored in advanced \nmaterial containers and all containers must meet federal \nstandards. Disposal sites have also been improved. Both \nabove-ground and below-ground vaults are now used.\nNUHOMS is a trademark of Transnuclear, Inc.\nCANDU is a trademark of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited.\n", "char_count": 3152, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_53", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Nuclear Waste Management", "is_complete_section": true}}
