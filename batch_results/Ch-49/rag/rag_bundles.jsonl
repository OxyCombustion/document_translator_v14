The control rod banks \nare grouped into shutdown and control (or regulating) \nbanks. The shutdown banks provide negative reactivity \nto bring the reactor from hot to cold conditions. During \na shutdown, the core temperature decreases and its \nreactivity increases. The shutdown control rod banks \ncounteract this increase. The controlling banks are \nused in conjunction with variations in the soluble boron \nconcentration to take the reactor from hot zero power \nto full power. These banks also provide the reactivity \nto handle rapid power changes. The negative reactivity \ncaused by the buildup of xenon in the core following a \nshutdown is offset by a combination of control rod re­\nmoval and decreases in the coolant boron concentration.\nThe reactivity worth of a control rod is a measure \nof its ability to alter core reactivity. Control rod worths \nare determined by first calculating the core with the \ncontrol rod inserted to determine its keff. The core is \nthen similarly calculated with the rod withdrawn. \nControl rod worth is defined as:\n\t\n\t\n(14)\nwhere\nkeff(i)\t =\t multiplication factor, control rod inserted\nkeff(w)\t =\t multiplication factor, control rod withdrawn\nBank worths are similarly calculated.\nReactivity coefficients\nReactivity coefficients define the rate of core reactiv­\nity change associated with the rate of change in reac­\ntor conditions. These coefficients indicate the relative \nsensitivity of the core operation to changes in operating \nparameters.\nIn determining a coefficient, the core is first modeled \nwith a given power and/or temperature distribution, \nand keff is calculated. The reactor is then similarly mod­\neled at a different power or temperature distribution. \nThe coefficient is defined as the reactivity change per \nunit of power or temperature. Fig. 14 shows the impact \nof various core parameter changes on core reactivity.\nIn PWRs, there are three basic reactivity coefficients \nthat are important to reactor operation: 1) moderator \ntemperature, 2) Doppler, and 3) power. The moderator \ntemperature coefficient is defined as the change in \nreactivity associated with a change in moderator tem­\nperature. It includes the effects of moderator density \nchanges and the changes in nuclear cross-sections. The \nDoppler coefficient is defined as the change in reactivity \nassociated with changes in fuel temperature that occur \nprimarily because of fuel nuclides with large resonances. \nThe power coefficient is defined as the change in reactiv­\nity associated with a change in power level. It is a com­\nbination of the moderator and Doppler coefficients and is \nbased on the change in temperature as power changes.\nWhen the coolant temperature increases, the associ­\nated water density reduction normally decreases its \nmoderating capability.

Coolant turning from water into steam results in \na further decline in core reactivity. Similarly, when the \nfuel temperature increases, core reactivity decreases. \nBoth mechanisms provide an inherent safety response \nfor the system. However, if the soluble boron concen­\ntration is too high, a positive moderator temperature \ncoefficient can occur, and core reactivity could increase. \nFor this reason, the combination of rod worth and boron \nconcentration is limited to ensure a negative moderator \ncoefficient at full power.\nNeutron Detectors\nWhen operating a nuclear chain reaction system, \nneutron detectors are used to measure the intensity of \nthe neutron radiation (flux). This radiation is a direct \nindication of nuclear reaction intensity. Neutron detec­\ntors can be counters or ionization chambers. Counters, \nwhich detect neutrons by sensing the individual ioniza­\ntions they produce, are most useful when the neutron \nflux is low. Ionization chambers are more useful at \nhigh neutron fluxes. They measure the electrical cur­\nrent that flows when neutrons ionize gas in a chamber. \nThese two types of detectors, placed on the exterior of \nthe pressure vessel, only measure neutrons leaking \nfrom the reactor.\nTwo other types of detectors, a self-powered neutron \ndetector and a miniature fission chamber, can be used \nto measure the neutrons inside the instrument tube of \noperating fuel assemblies. Self-powered detectors are \nusually arranged in strings and are positioned to con­\ntinuously measure the neutron reactions at up to seven \naxial locations in the fuel assembly. The miniature \nfission chamber contains uranium, and fission events \nare detected by the electronics. The fission chamber is \nmoved into and out of the core on a periodic basis, nor­\nmally monthly, and measures the neutron level along \nthe entire length of the fuel assembly.\nNeutron Source\nDuring the start of the chain reaction, it is essential \nthat the operator monitor nuclear instrumentation that \nis counting neutrons and not gamma rays. The mass of \nfuel in the core is much greater than the critical mass \nrequired to sustain a chain reaction. Control rods and \nsoluble boron dissolved in the reactor coolant keep the \ncore subcritical when no power output is required.\nFig. 14  Core reactivity as a function of operating parameters.\n", "char_count": 5536, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_007", "section_id": "chapter_14", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Neutron Detectors", "is_complete_section": true}}

With a neutron source available, it is pos­\nsible to accurately measure neutron flux before moving \ncontrol rods and to help ensure a safe reactor startup.\nSeveral types of neutron sources are available. One is \nan americium-beryllium-curium source rod. The radioac­\ntive isotopes americium and curium emit alpha particles \nwhich react with the beryllium to produce neutrons.\nFast Reactors\nIt is possible to design for a chain reaction to occur \npredominantly with either fast (high energy) neutrons \nor slow (thermal energy) neutrons. In fast reactors the \nchain reaction is maintained primarily by fast neutrons. \nThermal reactors are those in which the chain reaction \noccurs primarily from thermal neutrons. Today’s com­\nmercial water reactors are thermal reactors.\nFertile material such as U-238 can be used as a fuel \nby first converting it to plutonium in a reactor. Fast re­\nactors and particularly fast breeder reactors accomplish \nthis conversion most effectively. Liquid sodium, which \nhas essentially no moderating effect, is the coolant most \noften considered for fast breeders. Helium is used as a \ncoolant in high temperature gas-cooled reactor designs.\nConversion and breeding\nMost important of the conversion reactions is the \ncapture of a neutron by a U-238 nucleus, resulting in a \nnucleus of fissionable Pu-239:\n\t\n92\n238\n0\n1\n92\n239\n0\n0\n92\n239\n93\n239\n94\n239\n23\nU\nn\nU\nU\nNp\nPu\n+\n→\n+\n→\n→\nγ\nβ\nβ\n min.\n2.3 d\nThe U-238 nucleus absorbs a neutron and becomes \nU-239, which decays with a half life of 23 minutes, into \nneptunium-239 (Np-239). Again this nuclide, with a \nhalf life of 2.3 days, is transmuted to Pu-239 by β decay. \nThis is the nuclear process by which the most useful \nisotope of plutonium is formed.\nThere are other reactions during operation which \nform different isotopes of plutonium. Some of these \nisotopes, including Pu-241, are fissionable, and others, \nincluding Pu-240, are converted to fissionable isotopes \nby neutron absorption. These isotopes cannot be sepa­\nrated economically from Pu-239, and therefore must be \ntaken into account when plutonium is used in a reactor.\nThe large commercial PWRs in the U.S. operate on \nslightly enriched uranium fuel. These reactors convert \nU-238 to plutonium and produce about 50% as much \nplutonium as the U-235 consumed. A reactor is consid­\nered to be a converter when the amount of fissionable \nmaterial produced, e.g., plutonium, is less than the \namount of fissionable material consumed, e.g., U-235. A \nbreeder reactor is one in which more fissionable mate­\nrial is produced than consumed.\nBy definition, a breeder reactor must have the value \nof η (neutrons produced per neutron absorbed in fis­\nsionable fuel, Table 5) greater than 2.0. One neutron is \nrequired to maintain the chain reaction, one or more for \nthe breeding, and an additional fraction for absorption \nin nonfuel materials and leakage.\nIt is not possible to make a breeder reactor with \nnatural uranium fuel, because η is less than 2.0. Table \n5 shows that η does not greatly exceed 2.0 with any \ncommon fissionable isotopes for fissions produced by \nthermal neutrons. Consequently, it becomes difficult and \nimpractical to make a breeder with a thermal reactor.\nAt high neutron energies, η has a greater value than \nat thermal energies, particularly with Pu-239. For this \nreason, and because the absorption cross-sections of \nmost materials are less than at thermal energy, fast \nreactors breed plutonium more effectively than thermal \nreactors. In addition, fast reactors operate best with \nplutonium fuel.\n1.\t Evans, R.D., The Atomic Nucleus, R.E.

For example, placing a material of known \ndensity and thickness in front of a neutron source \npermits measuring the intensity of neutrons at a par­\nticular energy on each side of the material. The differ­\nence represents the loss or attenuation of neutrons by \nthe material. The cross-section required to obtain this \nattenuation is derived by calculation.\nIsotopes of the same element can have very differ­\nent cross-sections.

U-235 is fissionable at \nany energy, and U-238 only at high energy.\nCross-sections of some nuclides also contain abrupt \npeaks called resonances at certain energy bands (Fig. 5). \nBecause a cross-section is actually a function of rela­\ntive energy of the neutron and the nucleus, an effective \nchange in the cross-section results when the energies of \nthe neutron and the nucleus increase or decrease as a \nresult of temperature changes.\nWhere the curve of cross-section versus energy is \nfairly smooth, the effect of a temperature change of the \ntarget nucleus is relatively small. However, the effect \nof a temperature change is large and important in the \nvicinity of a resonance. An increase in temperature re­\nsults in increased vibration of the nucleus with a corre­\nsponding increase in the number of probable collisions \nbetween the nucleus and neutron occurring at energies \nin the vicinity of the resonance. Therefore, an increase \nin the temperature of the nucleus results in an apparent \nbroadening of the energy width of the resonance. This \nin turn results in a very effective increase in resonance \nneutron absorption, i.e., increased probability of cap­\nture and fission. Conversely, a decrease in temperature \nof the nucleus results in narrowing the resonance width \nand decreasing resonance absorption. The change in \nresonance energy width with temperature, known as \nthe Doppler Effect, is important in reactor control.\nFig. 5 illustrates a typical cross-section curve show­\ning the neutron capture cross-section of U-238 as a \nfunction of neutron energy.

In the fission of an atom due to \na neutron, the mass of the neutron plus its energy must \nbe equal to or greater than the mass defect associated \nwith the two fission products. U-235 is the only naturally \noccurring nuclide that is capable of undergoing fission \nby interaction with low energy or slow neutrons. Some \nof the artificially produced heavy nuclides are also fis­\nsionable with slow neutrons, including plutonium-239 \n(Pu-239) and U-233. Other nuclides such as U-238 and \nPu-242 require higher energy neutrons to cause fission.\nThis difference in fission capability occurs because \nthe binding energy of a nucleus is not only determined \nby its mass number, but also by whether the number of \nprotons and neutrons is even or odd. A nuclide with an \neven number of neutrons and protons, such as U-238, \nhas the highest binding energy per nucleon and requires \nthe most added energy to fission.

The distri­\nbution of neutrons produced by fission as a function of \nenergy has been determined from several experimental \nmeasurements, and typical results for U-235 and Pu-239 \nare shown in Fig. 8. Based on these measurements, the \naverage energy of fission neutrons is about 2 MeV; the \npeak of the energy distribution occurs at about 0.8 MeV.\nBurnup\nAs a mass of uranium undergoes fission it pro­\nduces energy. The term burnup is used to represent the \namount of energy produced per unit mass of the mate­\nrial. The units of burnup are megawatt days per metric \nton (MWd/tm) of initial heavy metal, e.g., uranium. One \nmegawatt day represents about 2.6 × 1021 fissions. A \nnuclear fuel assembly is typically discharged from the \nreactor when it has achieved a burnup of about 50,000 \nto 60,000 MWd/tm. In commercial power reactors that \nare fueled with uranium comprising mainly the isotope \nU-238, with 4% or less U-235, most of the energy pro­\nduced comes from the fissioning of U-235. At burnups \nof 50,000 MWd/tm only about 5% of the initial uranium \ncontent of the fuel assembly has fissioned. Even when \nthe other nuclear reactions that cause loss of the origi­\nnal uranium atoms are considered, there is still more \nthan 90% of the initial uranium remaining in the fuel \nassembly when it is discharged.\nFission products\nWhen a nucleus undergoes fission, experimental \nmeasurements have shown that predominantly two \nfission products or fragments are generated. The distri­\nbution of these fission products for U-235 fissions has \nalso been measured and is shown in Fig. 6. In fission, \nas in any nuclear reaction, there is always conserva­\ntion of total mass-energy so that one of the two fission \nproducts will come from each hump of the distribution.\nExamination of Fig. 6 reveals that mass number of \nthe fission products ranges from about 70 to 170 with \ntwo plateaus at approximately 95 and 135. Curves are \nshown for fission caused by thermal energy neutrons \nand by 14 MeV neutrons. The higher the neutron energy \ncausing fission the more uniform the fission product \ndistribution.\nMany fission products interact with neutrons, ab­\nsorbing them so that they are not available to the chain \nreaction. As these fission products build up (see Fig. 9), \nthey act as absorbers to retard the chain reaction. All \nlong-lived fission products (except samarium) build up \nas the core is operated, reaching a maximum effect at \nthe end of core life.\nTable 5\nNeutrons from Fission\n \n \nAvg.

These isotopes include stron­\ntium-90 (Sr-90), ruthenium-106 (Ru-106), cesium-134 \n(Cs-134) and 137 (Cs-137), cerium-144 (Ce-144) and \neuropium-154 (Eu-154).

In addition, the \ngamma emitting isotope cobalt-60 (Co-60) is produced \nin the structural steels and Inconel® through neutron \nactivation and must be shielded against.\nFission product behavior with time\nCertain fission products, specifically Xe-135 and \nsamarium-149 (Sm-149), both of which have very high \ncross-sections for absorption of thermal neutrons, are \nnot only produced directly from fission but also are the \ndecay products of other fission products.\nEssentially all initial products of fission are highly \nradioactive and decay rapidly to less active isotopes \nwith somewhat longer half lives. There are usually \nseveral isotopes in the chain before a stable end product \nis reached. The most significant such decay chain is the \nfollowing:\nIn this chain, tellurium-135 (Te-135) with a one min­\nute half life decays to iodine-135 (I-135) with a 6.7 hour \nhalf life and then to Xe-135. This xenon isotope has a \n9.2 hour half life and a thermal neutron absorption mac­\nroscopic cross-section of approximately 100,000 cm−1, \nwhich is as great as all the long-lived fission products \ntogether.

This changes some of the Xe-135 to \nXe-136 (which has negligible neutron absorption). As a \nresult, when a water reactor operates at constant power \nlevel, the Xe-135 builds up to an equilibrium value \nwhich is a function of reactor power. In a power reactor, \nthis equilibrium is reached in 36 to 48 hours.\nWhen reactor power decreases, and particularly \nwhen the reactor is shut down, the I-135 formed at the \noriginal power level continues for a time to generate Xe-\n135 at a rate corresponding to the original power level. \nTherefore, the Xe-135 builds up rapidly after shutdown \nbecause fewer neutrons are available for conversion to \nXe-136. The buildup reaches a peak 4 to 12 hours after \nshutdown and then slowly decays. The time behavior of \nXe-135 must be addressed in reactor control.\nSm-149, the second important fission product in the \nreactor core during operation, is generated as follows:\n\t\nIn the chain, neodymium-149 (Nd-149) decays (1.7 \nhour half life) into promethium-149 (Pm-149), which in \nturn decays (47 hour half life) into Sm-149. Although \nSm-149 is a stable isotope it is destroyed so rapidly \nby neutron absorption that it reaches an equilibrium \nvalue when the reactor operates at constant power. \nTypically, Sm-149 reaches equilibrium in a pressurized \nwater reactor (PWR) after 50 to 100 days. Buildup after \nshutdown is slower and less extensive than for Xe-135.\nDecay after shutdown has little consequence for all \nother fission fragments because of their long lives and \ncomparable capture cross-sections between parent and \ndaughter nuclide.\nNuclear Reactor Composition\nA reactor core is composed of fuel, structural and \ncontrol materials, and a moderator and/or coolant. \nTypical PWR fuel assembly and control component \ndesigns are shown in Fig. 10. A depiction of the interac­\ntions that take place within a fuel assembly is shown \nin Fig. 11. Neutrons react not only with uranium, but \nalso with the nuclei of most other elements present. \nTherefore, many materials which have high neutron \nabsorption properties should not be used for structural \npurposes.

Thermal reactor design, where the neu­\ntron energy distribution is essentially in thermal equi­\nlibrium with its surroundings, requires a moderator. A \nmoderator is a material capable of reducing the kinetic \nenergy of neutrons while absorbing a small number of \nthe neutrons.

Other low \nweight atoms can be used, but they are less practical \nbecause of excess neutron absorption or high material \ncost. Because the helium nucleus absorbs essentially no \nneutrons, it would be an ideal moderator except that \nhelium is a gas at reactor operating temperatures. Due \nto its low density and low mass, it would be impossible \nto provide the core with a sufficient number of atoms to \nbe an effective moderator.\nAll thermal reactors contain some fast (high energy) \nneutrons because fast neutrons result from fission. The \namount of moderator provided determines the degree \nof thermalization (energy reduction) or the percentage \nof thermal neutrons present in the reactor. Perhaps the \ngreatest advantage of the thermal reactor is its compat­\nibility with the water coolant. Water has proven to be \nthe most practical and economical coolant.\nThe low neutrons per fission available with natural \nuranium make it difficult to design a natural uranium \n(0.71% U-235) reactor. However, the design can be ac­\ncomplished if all materials have low absorption cross-\nsections, are of especially high purity, and if discrete \nsections of fuel are placed in a heterogeneous array \nsuch that the neutrons can thermalize in the moderator \nand then re-enter the fuel material as thermal neu­\ntrons. Under these conditions, there is a relative high \nprobability of causing fission. The normal moderators \nused in natural uranium reactors are either graphite \nor deuterium oxide (heavy water). The absorption cross-\nsection of normal hydrogen makes it less desirable than \nthe other moderators. Also, minute quantities of any \nhigh neutron absorbers can prevent a chain reaction. \nNevertheless, all early reactors used natural uranium \nand many still operate, notably the Canada Deuterium \nUranium (CANDU®) pressurized heavy water reactors. \n(See Chapter 47.)\nPhysical Description of Nuclear \nChain Reactions4-7\nTo use fission as a continuous process for power pro­\nduction, it is necessary to initiate and maintain a fis­\nsion chain reaction at a controlled rate or level that can \nbe varied with power demand. Obtaining a steady-state \nchain reaction requires the availability of more than \none neutron for each fission produced because nonfis­\nsion reactions absorb some neutrons and others leak \nfrom the reactor. For a reactor as a whole, the neutrons \nborn in each instant of time constitute one generation \nof neutrons. The term effective multiplication factor, keff, \nis defined as the ratio of the number of neutrons in one \ngeneration to that in the previous generation. A system \nwith a multiplication factor of less than one is decaying \nand will never be self-sustaining. With a multiplication \nfactor greater than one, a nuclear system produces \nmore neutrons than it uses, and power increases. For a \nsteady-state chain reaction, keff = 1.\nThe steady-state equation for neutron balance in a \nchain reaction can also be written as:\n\t\n\t\n(8)\nWhen this condition is obtained, the reactor is \ncritical meaning that the necessary amount of neutron \nproduction has been achieved to balance the leakage \nand the absorption of neutrons. The mass of fissionable \nmaterial required to achieve this condition is called the \ncritical mass.\nProduction, absorption and leakage all depend heav­\nily on interactions of neutrons with nuclei of the various \nProduction\nAbsorption + Leakage\n=\nFig. 10  Typical PWR fuel assembly and control components.\nFig. 11  PWR neutron moderator/coolant-fuel interactions.\n", "char_count": 3632, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_005", "section_id": "chapter_9", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Nuclear Reactor Composition", "is_complete_section": true}}

Production depends primarily \non those interactions with U-235 nuclei which result in \nfission. Absorption depends on interactions of neutrons \nwith any nuclei in the core that result in absorption of \nneutrons with or without fission. Leakage depends on \ngeometry and the scattering effect of collisions. The \nscattering effect of collisions between neutrons, nuclei \nand other particles results in transport of neutrons \ntoward the boundaries of the chain reacting system and \nultimate escape from the system.\nTable 5 indicates that each fission of a U-235 atom by \na thermal neutron makes available an average of 2.43 \nneutrons. However, only 2.07 neutrons are produced \nper thermal neutron absorbed in U-235 as also indi­\ncated in Table 5. The other 0.36 neutrons are absorbed \nin nonfission reactions. If natural uranium is used, \nthe number of neutrons produced per thermal neutron \nabsorbed is reduced to 1.34 because of the neutron \nabsorption in U-238. Most of this absorption results in \nthe ultimate production of fissionable Pu-239. However, \nneutrons used in this manner are no longer available to \nhelp maintain the chain reaction.\nA neutron chain reaction is possible because each \nfission event on the average produces more than one \nneutron. If the process is controlled such that just one \nof the neutrons produced from fission causes another \nfission reaction then a steady-state process is main­\ntained and a constant power level is achieved. To best \nunderstand the process, a general description of the \nlifetime of a neutron follows. It must be realized that \nfor a power reactor the number of neutrons crossing a 1 \ncm2 surface (neutron flux) near the center of the reactor \nis on the order of 1013 neutrons/cm2/s. The lifetime of a \nneutron is on the order of 10−9 seconds. Therefore, this \ndescription is only representative of what happens in an \ninstant of time.\nAs described previously, a neutron produced by the \nfission process has an average energy of about 2 MeV \nand is termed a fast neutron. At this energy, elastic or \ninelastic scattering reactions with the moderator, the \nfuel or with the structural materials are most probable. \nHowever, about 2% of the fast neutrons cause a fission \nin U-238 and produce an even higher number of neu­\ntrons than produced from thermal fission.\nIn an elastic scattering reaction some of the neutron \nenergy is transferred to the nucleus with which it collides \nin the form of kinetic energy; this can cause the nucleus \nto be displaced from its normal lattice position in the \nmaterial. In an inelastic collision a compound nucleus \nis formed in an excited state and it reduces its energy \nby releasing a lower energy neutron and a gamma ray. \nSome of the original neutron’s energy is also deposited \nas kinetic energy on the nucleus. The net impact of \nthe scattering reactions is to cause the neutron to lose \nenergy or slow down into the energy range where reso­\nnance interactions with various materials (especially \nU-238) can take place. In the resonance range, neutrons \nwill have a high probability of being captured if their \nenergy coincides with any of the resonances associated \nwith the uranium fuel or the fission products and will \nnot be available to react with the U-235 to help sustain \nthe chain reaction. The resonance escape probability \nis the fraction of neutrons that escape capture while \nslowing down to the thermal energy range. The term \nresonance escape refers particularly to U-238 because \nin the intermediate range of neutron energy there are \nseveral resonance peaks of absorption cross-section for \nthis isotope. These resonances are useful in the pro­\nduction of plutonium; however, to maintain criticality \nin a thermal reactor, sufficient neutrons must escape \nabsorption in the resonance region.\nIn contrast, collisions with hydrogen atoms in the \nmoderator can slow down the neutron very rapidly, and \ntherefore, the resonance escape probability is high for \nwater moderated systems. Once past the resonance \nrange the neutron is said to become thermalized and \nbecomes part of a Maxwellian energy distribution with \nan average energy of about 0.2 eV. Most fission reac­\ntions take place in this thermal energy range where \nthe fission cross-sections for U-235 and Pu-239 are the \nhighest.\nThe probability of having a fission reaction is re­\nferred to as the thermal utilization and is the ratio of \nthe fission cross-section to the absorption cross-section \n(capture plus fission) averaged over the moderator plus \nthe fuel and structural materials.\nThe other mechanism for loss of neutrons is leakage \nfrom the system. This is dependent on the shape and \nsize of the system and the length of the path neutrons \ntravel between source and capture. For a thermal reac­\ntor this length is approximately 2.95 in. (75 mm). Most \nof today’s power reactors are typically 13.1 ft (4 m) in \ndiameter and therefore only neutrons born in the fuel \nassemblies on the periphery of the core have a signifi­\ncant probability of being lost from the system.\nControl of the chain reaction\nMore than 99% of neutrons produced in fission are \nprompt neutrons; that is, they are produced almost \ninstantaneously. About 0.73%, in the case of U-235, are \nreleased by the decay of fission products rather than \ndirectly from fission. The average half life for these \ndelayed neutrons from fissioning of U-235 is about 13 \nseconds. This provides time for the reactor operator to \nrespond to small changes in either power demand by \nthe system or reactor system parameters.\nThe chain reaction can be regulated by placing ma­\nterials with high neutron absorption capability in the \nreactor and providing a means of varying their amounts. \nThese materials tend to stop the chain reaction and \ninclude boron, cadmium-silver-indium, hafnium and \ngadolinium. One or more of these materials usually goes \ninto the reactor in the form of control rods that can be \nwithdrawn to start up the reactor or to increase power \nlevel and reinserted to reduce power or to shut down the \nunit. To assure accurate control of power, at least some of \nthe rods must be capable of fine regulation.\nReactivity\nThe first step in establishing a chain reaction is to \nbring the reactor to critical condition at essentially no \nthermal power or zero power level. The reactor power is \ngradually increased to the desired level by the removal \nof a control material and maintained there.

The above equations then become a coupled set \nof partial differential equations that are solved in both \nthe space and energy domains to find the neutron flux \nand reaction rates in each node.\nIn the design of the early reactors, most calculations \nof reactor physics parameters were done by hand using \nhomogeneous models of the core components. Neutron \ncross-sections were obtained from experimental plots of \ntotal, absorption, scattering and fission cross-sections. \nCritical experiments were performed mocking up the \nfuel designs and modeling both the fuel and control \nrods. From these experiments, modeling adjustments \nwere developed to ensure high accuracy predictions of \nreactor performance parameters. As with most other \ndisciplines, the advent of more powerful computers has \npermitted the designer to perform detailed calculations \nin both space and energy. The following sections describe \nsome techniques that have been used in calculations for \ncommercial PWR fuel cycle design and licensing.\nCross-sections\nBasic neutron and gamma cross-sections are com­\npiled and verified as part of the industry effort to main­\ntain the cross-section libraries. These libraries provide \nthe basic data needed to calculate the cross-section of \neach isotope as a function of incident neutron energy. \nTypically two major energy groups, each containing \nsubgroups, are used by the designer. The first, the fast \nand epithermal group, spans energies from 1.85 eV to \n20 MeV and is composed of 40 or more subgroups. The \nsecond, the thermal energy group, covers energies from \n0.00001 eV to 1.85 eV and is composed of 50 or more \nsubgroups. In the fast and epithermal energy range, \nonly scattering reactions that decrease neutron energy \nare used in the calculations. In the thermal energy \nrange, the neutron energies are in thermal equilibrium \nwith the moderator, and energy can be imparted to the \nneutron during scattering collisions. Therefore, scatter­\ning reactions, which can increase or decrease neutron \nenergy, are permitted in the calculations for this group.\nWhen designing a reactor core, specific cross-sections \nare calculated using the total multigroup cross-section \nset (40 epithermal plus 50 thermal groups) for each \nmaterial present. Each cell type in the fuel assembly \ncan then be modeled. (See Fig. 12.) This calculation \ndetermines the neutron flux distribution in each energy \ngroup and cell. The resulting neutron flux is then used \nto average the cross-sections over the two major energy \ngroups and over various regions of the fuel assembly.

It is impractical to pro­\nvide the absorption using control rods in large PWRs. \nTherefore, for long-term control, keff = 1 is typically \nmaintained by soluble boron in the moderator (boron \ndissolved in water) and/or burnable absorbers. Burn­\nable absorbers contain a limited concentration of ab­\nsorber atoms such that, as neutrons are absorbed, the \neffectiveness of absorption decreases and essentially \nburns out with time. Burnable absorbers may be in the \nfuel rods or in fixed absorber rods that are placed in \nfuel assembly guide tubes.

Over the next 24 centuries there were \nmany theories on the basic structure of matter but all \nlacked any experimental basis. It was not until the \nlate nineteenth and early twentieth centuries that the \nexistence of fundamental particles, the proton, neutron \nand electron, was confirmed.\nThe discovery of nuclear fission, credited to Otto \nHahn, Lise Meitner and Fritz Strassman, was made \npossible through an accumulation of knowledge on the \nstructure of matter beginning with Becquerel’s 1896 \ndetection of radioactivity. Fission, as defined within \nthis chapter, is the splitting of a nucleus into two or \nmore separate nuclei accompanied by release of a large \namount of energy.\nAs shown in Fig. 1, the structure of an atom is pic­\ntured as a dense, positively charged nucleus surrounded \nby an array of negatively charged electrons. Each proton, \nthe equivalent of a hydrogen atom nucleus, carries an \nelemental positive charge of electricity. The number of \nprotons determines the type of chemical element of the \natom. Each neutron is an electrically neutral particle \nwith a mass slightly greater than the proton. Because \nof their association with the nucleus of the atom, protons \nand neutrons are also referred to as nucleons. Each \nelectron shown orbiting around the nucleus has an el­\nemental negative charge and a mass about 1/2000 that \nof a proton. The nucleus of an atom with a characteristic \nnumber of neutrons and protons is called a nuclide.\nAtoms are extremely small; atomic radii are conven­\ntionally measured in pico-meters. Despite the minute \nsize of the atom, there is a relatively great distance \nbetween the nucleus and the orbiting electrons. This \ndistance, approximately 105 times the dimension of the \nnucleus, accounts for the ability of various radiations to \npass through apparently dense materials.\nFig. 1 also indicates the relationship of the posi­\ntively charged protons in the nucleus and the negatively \ncharged electrons. The ratio of protons and electrons \nin the atom dictates its ionic state. In the un-ionized \nstate, the number of protons is balanced by an equal \nnumber of electrons. An atom becomes ionized by gain­\ning or losing one or more electrons. A gain of electrons \nyields negative ions and a loss results in positive ions. \nAn atom in an ionized state can interact with other ele­\nments to form various compounds.\nWhen an atom has more than two electrons, their \norbits are located in a series of separate and distinct \ngroupings of energy levels or shells. Each shell is capable \nof containing a specific number of electrons. In general, \nan inner shell fills to its maximum number of electrons \nbefore electrons begin to form in the next shell. An x-ray \nis a quantum of electromagnetic energy that is emitted \nwhen an electron transitions from an outer shell to an in­\nner shell or between energy levels within the same shell.\nThe number of electrons in the outermost shell de­\ntermines certain chemical properties of the elements. \nThe properties are similar for elements which have \nsimilar electron distributions in the outer shell regard­\nless of the number of inner shells. This accounts for the \nrepetition of chemical properties in the Periodic Table of \nthe Elements.
