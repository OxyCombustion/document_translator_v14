To meet carbon dioxide \n(CO2) reduction targets and to reduce fossil fuel depen­\ndency, policymakers in many countries are encouraging \nincreased biomass-fired energy production.\nBiomass energy production is widespread throughout \nthe world. Biomass is a readily available renewable energy \nsource derived from organic material. Predominantly, \nbiomass fuels originate from wood-processing residues \nand are utilized in hundreds of commercial operations. \nBiomass is a dispatchable fuel, meaning harvested \nbiomass can be stockpiled and available to meet energy \ndemands. This makes biomass more reliable than wind \nand solar for electricity production. Biomass is also a \nrenewable energy solution in areas where wind, solar or \nhydro energy are not readily available.\nBiomass fuels are classified as closed loop or open loop. \nA closed loop biomass fuel is defined as any organic plant \ngrown as high yield energy crop. Examples of closed loop \nfeedstock are switchgrass and eucalyptus. Closed loop \nbiomass projects are often structured around long-term \nfuel supply contracts that support plant economics. \nHowever, the vast majority of biomass power generation \ntoday is open loop meaning biomass is obtained from a \nvariety of regional supply sources.\nMany technologies are available to transform raw \nbiomass material directly or indirectly into process steam \nand/or electricity. These technologies include direct firing, \nco-firing with another fuel, gasification, torrefaction and \npelletization. Most current biomass power generators \nare direct fired and produce 50 MW or less of electricity. \nPlants are owned and operated by various stakeholders, \nfrom industrial users, e.g., pulp and paper mills and \nlumber companies, to power utilities and independent \npower producers.\nAs a fuel, biomass is not without challenges and in \nsome instances it can be more difficult to burn than \ncoal. Understanding and controlling biomass moisture \nand ash content is important. Integrating biomass \ninto a fuel mix requires careful consideration of firing \ntechnologies, steam cycle conditions, tube materials, \nmaterial handling, and emissions control systems.\nSpurred by Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) or \nRenewable Energy Standards (RES), impending carbon \nlegislation, and public concerns about the environment, \npower producers throughout the world are considering \nalternatives to lower emissions and incorporate more \nChapter 30\nBiomass Installations\nrenewable energy into their electricity generation mix. \nWhile wind, solar and other renewable energy sources \nare viable options, utilities may find biomass attractive \ndue to feedstock proximity and availability, reliability and \ncost of generation. The key is to thoroughly understand \nlong-term fuel supply infrastructure and cost, combustion \ntechnologies, and the required environmental systems. \nA repowering project adds further complexity as existing \nequipment must be assessed for new, and perhaps more \nchallenging, operating conditions.\nBiomass Supply Chain\nThe biomass supply chain differs from coal. Fig. \n1 illustrates the biomass resource availability in the \nUnited States (U.S.).1 Biomass lacks the consistency of \ncoal because biomass fuels can originate from multiple \nsources with widely variable properties, such as particle \nsize, moisture content, contaminants, degrees of decom­\nposition, and seasonal availability. Biomass combustion \ntechnologies therefore must be fuel flexible and be able to \naccommodate feedstock variety. The following are some \ncommon biomass fuel sources.\nWoody biomass represents one of the most read­\nily accessible biomass fuel sources. (See Fig. 2.) Woody \nbiomass residues originate from forest thinning or timber \nharvesting, pulping processes, lumber manufacture and \nfurniture production.\nIn-forest residues (also known as slash) include \nwaste from timber harvesting, forest management and \nclearing operations. Slash includes treetops, limbs, \nbark and commercially unacceptable trees. Mechanical \novergrowth thinning is expensive and presents collection \nand transportation challenges. Further, the use of slash \nas a feedstock requires a fuel yard and feed system that \ncan accommodate variability. Regardless, slash is a viable \nfuel source, but requires the power plant to be in close \nproximity to the harvesting operations.\nAgricultural wastes are farming industry byproducts. \nAgricultural wastes such as pits, shells, hulls, orchard \nprunings, bagasse, corn stover, straw, or other field stalks \nare suitable biomass fuels but also present challenges. \n(See Fig. 3.) Agricultural wastes have the disadvantage \nof seasonality and competition from farming operations. \nIn addition, the ash characteristics of silage and other \nagricultural wastes can result in boiler cleanability and \ncorrosion issues.\nEnergy crops are grown specifically as a fuel.

Experience with \nplanting and harvesting hybrid crops as a renewable fuel \nis limited. Like agricultural wastes, ash characteristics \nmay be problematic.\nOpportunity fuels are comprised of yard trimmings, \nconstruction and demolition waste, scrap pallets, packag­\ning, furniture, or other discarded wood-based debris. \nThe disadvantage of opportunity fuels is the residual \nchemicals that may be part of the waste which affect \nash chemistry, ash fusion temperature and products of \ncombustion. Urban waste has the advantage of offsetting \nlandfill disposal costs.\nPelletizing is a process that converts biomass into a fuel \nwith coal-like properties. Pellets are formed in a process \nthat dries, mills, conditions and extrudes the biomass to \nthe end product. (See Fig. 4.) A variety of biomass feed­\nstocks can be used. The process grinds oversized material \nand compacts the fine feedstock into a homogeneous, \ndense, high energy fuel.

Biomass pellets contain low moisture, are \nclean, and are easy to handle and transport. Pellets are \nconsidered a proven biomass technology and a convenient \nfuel for co-firing with coal. An initial pellet size reduction, \ntypically using hammer mills, may be required if final \ncombustion sizing is achieved with existing pulverizers. \nBiomass pellets must be sheltered from the weather as \nthey will swell and decompose when exposed to moisture \nand humidity. For this reason, pellets are stored indoors \nrather than in an open fuel yard. Covered pellet storage \nis therefore an additional fuel handling system cost.\nTorrefied wood is processed biomass with superior \nhandling and co-firing capabilities as compared to pellets. \nHarvested biomass is heated in the absence of oxygen to \nremove moisture and volatiles. The biomass decomposes \ninto a brittle, nonfibrous, uniform char product with a \nheating value approaching that of coal. The char is then \nprocessed into pellets. Torrefied pellets are hydrophobic, \ni.e., they do not absorb water, and thus, can be stored \noutdoors and handled like coal. Their brittleness improves \ngrindability, allowing co-firing with coal at rates greater \nthan nontorrefied pellets. The ability to handle and store \ntorrefied biomass, being much like coal, can significantly \nreduce the capital cost required for a co-firing conversion \nof an existing coal-fired plant.\nBiomass Characteristics\nBiomass is a renewable fuel that can be combusted \nusing a variety of technologies. Each installation must \naddress the issues and challenges related to fuel avail­\nability, seasonal changes, material handling, combustion, \nemissions control and operational constraints. A \nbiomass-powered facility must balance equipment and \nlocation with innovative strategies to achieve high plant \nefficiency and required emissions with low capital and \noperating costs.\nAvailability\nIn the U.S., biomass is readily available in most parts \nof the country primarily as woody biomass consisting of \nslash, mill residue, bark and wood not suitable for pulping. \n(See Fig. 1.) Much like coal, as demand increases, the \nbiomass supply will more likely be locked into long-term \ncontracts. Other plentiful biomass fuel resources include \nswitchgrass, corn stover, corn cobs and other waste \nstreams like refuse-derived fuels, waste paper, cardboard, \netc. The ability to fire a diverse feedstock requires a well \ndesigned fuel handling system. Failure to address fuel \nvariability can result in operational limitations, forced \noutages and lost revenue.\nAgricultural waste tends to be seasonally available \nwhile forest harvesting products and slash (nonvalue \ntrees, tree tops, and branches) are available throughout \nthe year. If a steady, reliable source of biomass is not \nreadily available, a power plant may be forced to utilize op­\nportunity fuels. Properties of such fuels may vary widely. \nAgricultural waste material may contain constituents \nfrom fertilizer that may be corrosive or promote boiler \nslagging and fouling. Construction and demolition wastes \ncan contain contaminants that increase regulated air \nemissions. A thorough understanding of fuel character­\nistics is necessary.\nFuel handling and storage\nAlthough harvested biomass can be delivered by barge \nor rail, truck delivery is the most common. (See Fig. 5.) \nWhen delivering by truck, the volume of truck traffic is \nthe most visible part of the operation and the road delivery \ninfrastructure must be able to handle the traffic. For \nexample, a 50 MW unit will require approximately 100 \ntrucks per day. Biomass-fired systems of 50 MW or less \ntypically have the advantage of using locally sourced \nwood, drawing from a 50-mile radius which helps defray \ntransportation costs. Beyond this distance, transporta­\ntion logistics become prohibitive.\nWood chips have relatively low mass heating value \nand low bulk density that combine to significantly \nreduce its volumetric heating value. As a result, more \nfuel is required and wider belt conveyors are necessary \nto deliver and store the energy equivalent to other solid \nfuels. Plants firing wood chips, for example, require eight \ntimes the volume of bituminous coal on a Btu/ft3 (kJ/m3) \nbasis. The increased storage, processing and handling \nsystem space required can become significant for large \nbiomass-fired plants.\nFuel handling system design is a key technical \nrequirement for biomass fuels.

Screens and hogs are typically used to \ncontrol particle size. Blending is important for controlling \nproperties and characteristics. For co-firing applications, \nthe properties of biomass, coal and possibly other solid \nfuels can be blended. The objective is to meet the combus­\ntion, emissions and economic constraints.\nThe removal of tramp material is a necessary step \nto improve biomass quality and consistency. Nonferrous \nmetal separation, magnetic separators and screens must \nbe used to prepare the biomass. Rocks, debris, metals \nand other contaminants should not be fed directly to \nthe boiler.\nWood chips, slash and other agricultural products \nhave poor material handling characteristics. Biomass fuel \nparticles compress, mat and become entwined when piled \nor placed in a bin. Biomass blends can have very poor flow \ncharacteristics. Particle size, shape and compressibility \nall contribute to this phenomenon. To promote movement, \nbins are often designed with negative slope wall angles, \nwider at the bottom than at the top. Material conveyance \nmust be carefully considered when choosing chute angles \nand liner materials.\nStoring large volumes of biomass fuel is another \nchallenge. Wet biomass (>60% moisture) does not pose a \nspontaneous combustion hazard, but it will degrade due to \nbiological activity. At moisture levels between 20 and 60%, \ntypical for most biomass fueled plants, both degradation \nand spontaneous combustion are concerns. Biomass \nparticle surface area and irregular shape provide a near \nideal environment for fiber breakdown, biological heating \nand spontaneous combustion. Conversely, dry biomass \n(<20% moisture) is relatively stable and can be stored \nfor long periods of time.\nFuel Properties\nProper combustion technology selection requires \nrepresentative fuel analyses, ash mineral analyses, \nand expected seasonal variation of the fuel. Biomass \nfuels are generally characterized by proximate and \nultimate analyses and gross calorific value according to \nASTM-E870. Ash elemental analyses can be evaluated \naccording to different ASTM standards. (See Chapter \n9.) Fuel and ash analyses should be obtained for every \nrepresentative fuel source to identify constituents that \nmay be detrimental to the boiler and ancillary equipment. \nTable 1 provides typical proximate, ultimate and ash \nanalyses for select biomass fuels.\nMoisture\nTypical moisture content values of biomass range \nbetween 20 and 60%. On a dry basis, biomass fuels have \nmore volatiles and a greater hydrogen-to-carbon ratio \nthan coals, making them more reactive. This means \nbiomass can be fired efficiently if sufficiently dry. Caution \nis necessary because spontaneous combustion during \nhandling and storage is a potential hazard. To fire \nany wet waste fuel, energy is required to evaporate the \nmoisture. Combustion calculation methods are discussed \nin Chapter 10. The moisture from fuel loss is one of the \nmost significant heat losses when calculating boiler \nefficiency for biomass fuels.\nFuel constituents\nFuel constituents dictate combustion air require­\nments, flue gas flow rates, uncontrolled emissions, and \nthe heat distribution between the radiant and convection \nsections. These parameters will vary as the fuel varies. \nThe influence of biomass constituents on boiler design, \nefficiency, heat transfer effectiveness, and environmental \nimpact is presented in Table 2.\nBiomass has low inherent ash, but when harvesting \nwood or other bio-crops, incidental ash is often picked \nup in the form of sand from dragging timber, dirt from \nroots, etc. Also, soil conditions or coastal locations may \npromote an increase in alkalis and chlorine that may \ncause corrosion. Chlorine can originate from salt in the \nsoil, by floating logs in salt water, road salt, or by growing \ncrops in brackish water. Some biomass has naturally \nhigh chlorine content, particularly new, green growth. \nWhen chlorine content exceeds 0.1%, superheater tube \nmetallurgy must be carefully selected.\nAgricultural-based fuels (nonwoody biomass) are \noften considered difficult for combustion. This is \nespecially true for straw, which contains high concentra­\ntions of silica, potassium and chlorine. When straw is \ncombusted, condensation of potassium chloride results \nin ash deposition and high temperature corrosion. Straw \nhas a high ash content (3 to 10%) compared to woody \nbiomass, making ash removal a challenge. Straw ash \nhas a relatively low melting point often resulting in \nslag formation.\nBiomass fuel can be high in chlorine, but is typically \nlow in sulfur. Sulfur tends to moderate the affect of \nchlorine and a sulfur-to-chlorine ratio greater than 2.0 \nis generally desired. The combination of high chlorine, \nalkalis and some sulfur forms a low melting (often \nmolten phase), highly corrosive eutectic that can reduce \nsuperheater life.\nFuel sizing\nFuel preparation requirements are driven by the \ncombustion process, primarily furnace residence time. \nFurnace residence time is necessary for complete combus­\ntion of gaseous products and char burnout. Particle mass, \nsize, shape and volatile content are key parameters to \nconsider. Each combustion technology has a preferred \nfuel size distribution. Mass firing technologies, such as \ngrate-fired and bubbling fluidized-bed (BFB) boilers, have \nlong furnace residence times and can accommodate larger \n[4 to 6 in. (102 to 152 mm)], as-delivered fuel particles. \nToo many fine particle sizes may promote excessive \ncarryover. Co-firing biomass with coal requires a fine \nparticle size less than 0.0625 in. (2 mm) due to the short \nfurnace residence times associated with pulverized coal \n(PC)-fired boilers. If grassy fuel is in the co-firing mix, \nit should be limited to 2 in. (50 mm) in length maximum \nbecause it is difficult to pulverize.\nThe goal is to provide an even fuel size distribution \nwithin the manufacturer’s specified design range. \nIncomplete combustion reduces boiler efficiency and leads \nto higher fuel feed rates and increased unburned carbon \n(UBC) in the furnace and downstream ash collection \nhoppers. UBC in the ash may increase the potential for \nhopper, economizer, air heater, precipitator and/or fabric \nfilter fires, as well as ash disposal issues.\n", "char_count": 6407, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_30", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Biomass Installations", "is_complete_section": true}}

Grate-fired, BFB and CFB boilers \nare proven biomass firing technologies. (See Figs. 6, 7 \nand 8.) Fuel preferences for each combustion technology \nare shown in Fig. 9.\nThe majority of new biomass boiler installations are 100 \nMW or less, as driven by fuel availability, transportation \nand handling. Most new direct-fired units utilize grate, \nBFB or CFB technology. With the increased demand \nfor renewable energy, power generators are evaluating \nexisting pulverized coal-, oil- or gas-fired boilers to assess \nbiomass firing capability. A viable biomass conversion \nstrategy is to co-combust biomass with pulverized coal. \nIn such an application, biomass is typically limited to no \nmore than 20% of the fuel heat input. For higher input \nrates, a more capital intensive approach is to retrofit a \ngrate or BFB to an existing PC-fired unit. This strategy \nhas several advantages. Fuel sizing requirements are \nmore generous. Fuel handling is simpler and the unit \ncan have up to 100% biomass firing capability. When \nretrofitting a grate or BFB bottom, one alternative is \nto support the combustion technology off of the existing \nfurnace walls whereby the structural loads of the retrofit \nare carried to the top steel. Another alternative is to \nindependently bottom support the new grate or BFB, \nso that new loads are not added to existing structural \nsteel. The limiting retrofit parameter is typically flue \ngas velocities or furnace residence time. Firing biomass, \nespecially high moisture biomass, can have gas weights \n30 to 50% greater than coal. Since convection pass \nvelocities increase proportionally, high gas velocities \nmay cause erosion from particulate carryover. With 60 \nft/s (18.3 m/s) convection pass velocities, a 30% reduction \nfrom maximum continuous rating (MCR) can be expected \nwhen firing biomass.\nGrate firing  Grate- (stoker) fired boilers are the \noldest commercial combustion technology still in use \ntoday. (See Fig. 6.) There are several grate types which \nare capable of firing biomass.

{"chunk_id": "unit_001_page_007", "page_number": 7, "text": "30-7\nSteam 42 / Biomass Installations\nThe Babcock & Wilcox Company\nModern biomass grate-fired units typically use \nwater- or air-cooled vibrating grates depending on the \nfuel moisture content. (See Chapter 16.) Wood firing on \na grate is very similar to spreader-stoker coal firing. The \nwood is fed over the fuel bed and distributed uniformly \nacross the grate area. Fine particles ignite and burn in \nsuspension. The coarser fuel particles fall to the grate \nand combust on a thin, fast-burning bed. Fuel is evenly \ndistributed across the active grate area and combustion \n(undergrate) air is uniformly distributed through the \ngrate. A portion of the total combustion air is admitted \nthrough ports above the grate as overfire air (OFA). It is \nimportant to retain a layer of ash on the grate as a shield \nfrom furnace radiation.\nFluidized-bed combustion  Fluidized-bed technol­\nogy (Chapter 17) is the most flexible for firing a wide \nrange of fuels or fuels with variable properties. The \nchoice between BFB and CFB technology depends mostly \non boiler size and fuel choice. BFB boilers (Fig. 7) are \npreferred when firing 100% biomass or similar low-grade \nfuels with high moisture and volatile content. BFB units \nwith capacities up to 100 MW have been installed. CFB \nboiler technology (Fig. 8) is generally applied to larger \ncapacity units with a broad range of high fixed carbon \nfuels. Both the BFB and CFB can be configured with \nhigh temperature heat transfer surface (superheat and \nreheat) for improved overall cycle efficiencies.\nThe CFB boiler lends itself to co-firing and can fire \na variety of solid fuels. The relatively low combustion \ntemperatures, reduced fuel preparation requirements, \nand inherently low uncontrolled emissions make it well \nsuited to firing low quality, high ash, high sulfur coal and \nbiomass fuels. The low ash and low sulfur characteristics \nof biomass fuels make them an attractive blend with coal.\nIn general, grate-fired boilers and BFB boilers have \nlower capital and operating costs than CFB boilers with \nsimilar capacities. Grate-fired boilers have a higher toler­\nance for fuel variation (moisture, ash characteristics, size \ndistribution) than BFBs or CFBs. Fluid-bed technologies \noperate with lower combustion temperatures and have \nbetter uncontrolled emissions than stoker units.\nSuspension firing  Direct suspension firing of bio-\nmass is an option for smaller, older, less efficient pulver­\nized coal-fired units. Suspension-fired boilers utilize \nburners to mix fine pulverized fuel particles and air. \nCombustion occurs in-flight rather than on a grate or in \na fluidized bed. Biomass co-firing is the simultaneous \ncombustion of biomass and other fossil fuels.\nCo-firing biomass with coal provides a means of \nreducing the potential environmental impact associated \nwith the combustion of fossil fuels. In many U.S. states, \nco-fired systems qualify for renewable energy credits \nand count toward meeting a state’s RPS or RES goals. \nIssues that must be considered when determining the \nfeasibility of converting a unit to co-firing capability \ninclude the physical and chemical characteristics of the \nfuels, permitting, financing, and securing the source of \nfeedstock. Co-firing is considered the most cost-effective \ntechnology for implementing near-term steam genera­\ntion from biomass because the costs of retrofitting an \nexisting plant are significantly less than building a new \nfacility. A primary advantage of this technology is that \nit utilizes existing assets and infrastructure and turns \na homogeneous fuel-based power plant into a flexible \nenergy conversion facility.\nDepending on the biomass constituents, biomass co-\nfiring can contribute from 5 to 20% of the total heat input \nneeded in a pulverized coal-fired boiler without convection \npass modifications. Typically, biomass moisture levels \nin the range of 10 to 30% are desired. High utility cycle \nsteam temperatures increase the risk of corrosion when \nexposed to the corrosive flue gas. Direct suspension \nfiring improves the combustion efficiency compared to \ngrate or fluidized-bed combustion, but the higher energy \nconsumption and complexity of the pulverizer system \nmust be considered.\nBiomass may be sized for combustion using existing \ncoal pulverizers (mills). The term co-milling refers to \nfeeding coal and biomass to the mills, grinding the fuels \nsimultaneously, and then pneumatically conveying the \npulverized blend to the burner(s). Biomass can be directly \nadded to the coal feeders, but does not grind or mill the \nsame as coal and typically requires much more power \nFig. 8  Circulating fluidized-bed boiler.\nFig. 9  Fuel preferences for various biomass combustion technologies.\n", "char_count": 4743, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_30", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Biomass Installations", "is_complete_section": true}}

This \nlimits the amount of biomass that can be co-fired and \nmay cause a derating of unit capacity.\nWhen co-firing biomass and coal at low input rates \n(about 2 to 3% of fuel heat input) there are fewer concerns \nrelated to boiler performance. But co-milling biomass, at \neven low input rates, can reduce coal fineness and thus \nincrease unburned carbon. As biomass input increases, \nflame stability and turndown without igniters will \nbecome more difficult. Generally, biomass should be \nco-milled through all pulverizers due to increased mill \npressure drop and recirculating load. In most cases, \nexisting pulverizers will require modifications to achieve \nsatisfactory particle size reduction.\nBiomass can be pre-sized on site prior to pulver­\nizing. This requires additional capital equipment (e.g., \nshredders and hammer mills) and separate biomass \nand coal material handling systems. Prepared biomass \ncan either be fed directly to dedicated burners or to dual \nfuel burners.\nCo-firing wood pellets with coal can impact both \nmilling and combustion. Pellets are easy to handle but \npulverization is limited to their inherent particle size. \nAt low input rates this may be acceptable with existing \npulverizers. If the pellets are being co-fired at high input \nrates, supplemental size reduction may be required to \nachieve a final particle size of 0.0625 in. (2 mm) or less. \nPelletized and torrefied fuels can successfully increase \nthe co-firing rate to 25 to 50%, perhaps more, with \nthe proper fuel preparation and combustion system \nmodifications.\nBiomass can be supplied to dual fuel (coal and biomass) \nor dedicated biomass burners. Equipment layout, retrofit \nmodifications and capital expenses may result in firing \nlimitations and/or compromises in the design. Existing \nburners can be modified with small dedicated biomass \nnozzles, but biomass input will be limited by the size of the \nnozzle. High biomass inputs will require new burners and \nin some cases, modified furnace wall openings. The ideal \nburner is one that can co-fire biomass and pulverized coal, \nalone or in combination, within NOx and CO performance \nrequirements.\nIndirect firing\nIn contrast to direct firing where solid fuel is burned \nwithin the boiler, indirect firing is a co-firing or repower­\ning option where biomass is gasified (see Chapter 18) by \nan indirect system and the gas produced is delivered \nto the boiler. The gasification process is the thermal \ndecomposition of biomass with little or no oxygen to yield \na synthesis gas. The syngas is a mixture of hydrogen \nand CO. Its quality and quantity depend on the native \nbiomass constituents, moisture content, temperature, \npressure and gasification technology. Syngas heating \nvalues range from 100 to 500 Btu/ft3 (3700 to 18,600 kJ/\nm3) and can be fired with conventional burners as a low \nheat content gas. \nThe syngas is scrubbed to remove undesirable \ncontaminants and is conditioned to lower sulfur and \nadjust the hydrogen-to-CO ratio prior to the boiler. The \ngasification byproducts are noncondensable gases such \nas methane and CO2, tars and high ash char. Removal \nof these contaminants reduces slagging, fouling and the \nFig. 10  Biomass gasification installation.\ncorrosion risk associated with direct co-firing.\nIndirect co-firing can be designed for greater fuel flex­\nibility than possible with direct co-firing or repowering \nwith grate or fluidized-bed combustion technologies. This \nflexibility reduces the risk of variable biomass availability \nand price fluctuations by broadening fuel options. From \nan operations standpoint, eliminating variability will \nimprove boiler stability. In a co-firing condition, market­\nability of the coal ash is not compromised. Likewise, the \nbiomass ash may have a beneficial use as a fertilizer \nsupplement. Fig. 10 shows a biomass gasification instal­\nlation in Japan.\nCombustion Considerations\nEffective biomass combustion requires a thorough \nunderstanding of fuel moisture (efficiency), ash (slag­\nging, fouling, corrosion and erosion) and uncontrolled \ngaseous emissions. These factors can impact combustion \nefficiency, operational stability, emissions, and power \nplant maintenance. The following are some key design \nconsiderations.\nEfficiency\nBiomass moisture is vaporized during the combustion \nprocess. This is an energy penalty of about 1000 Btu/\nlb (2326 kJ/kg) of moisture fed to the boiler which is \nsignificant for a typical 20 to 60% moisture biomass \nfeedstock. For nearly dry biomass the penalty is tolerable. \nAs fuel moisture increases, air, fuel and flue gas flow rates \nwill all increase. The result is increased parasitic power \ndemand (predominantly combustion fans and pulverizers) \nand increased operating and maintenance costs.\nSlagging\nBiomass ash containing high sodium, potassium and \nsilica can combine to form a low melting point ash that \ncan easily deposit on boiler tubes. As the deposit layer \nthickens, the gas-side surface temperature increases \ndue to the insulating properties of the deposit. Once \nthe deposit surface temperature exceeds the ash fusion \ntemperature, the deposit becomes sticky, enhancing ash \n", "char_count": 5281, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_30", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Biomass Installations", "is_complete_section": true}}

The ash layer can grow very quickly \nand become a plastic molten deposit. The under-slag \ndeposit is cooler, solidified and has sufficient structural \nintegrity to remain attached to the tube. Slagging occurs \nin the hotter regions of a boiler, typically the furnace and \nsometimes the higher temperature superheater banks. \nCo-firing biomass and coal can further reduce the ash \nmelting temperatures and increase furnace slagging. \nStraw and certain biomass species have severe slagging \ncharacteristics.\nSlagging can be controlled with appropriately placed \nsootblowers. (See Chapter 24.) Indirect biomass firing, \ni.e., gasification with gas cleanup, can prevent the slag­\nging concerns that occur with direct-fired combustion \ntechnologies.\nFouling\nFouling is defined as the formation of high temperature \nbonded deposits on convective tube banks not exposed \nto radiant heat. The deposits form when volatilized ash \ncomponents condense. Since alkali metals generally \nenhance ash volatilization, biomass, when combined \nwith coal, has increased fouling tendencies. Ash fouling \nhinders heat transfer, can be corrosive, and degrades \nboiler efficiency. Fouling is controlled with sootblowers. \nSootblower selection and placement are based on ash \ncharacteristics and bank arrangement. Indirect firing \nremoves ash, precipitates and volatile alkalis in the \ngasifier, minimizing fouling by sending a clean syngas \nto the boiler.\nCorrosion\nCorrosion-inducing biomass constituents are the \nalkali metals and chlorine. Woody biomass generally \npresents one of the lowest corrosion risks because its \nash contains low levels of chlorine and alkali. The risk of \ncorrosion increases with agricultural fuels and grasses. \nWhereas woody biomass might have 0 to 0.01% of chlorine, \nherbaceous grasses and agricultural residues like straw, \nswitchgrass, corn stover and cobs might contain more \nthan 0.3% chlorine. Although this seems small, alkali \nchlorides are the most stable chlorine species. Combustion \nvaporizes the alkali chlorides and they condense on the \nboiler tubes as highly aggressive, corrosive deposits, \nespecially on high temperature superheater sections. \nThe corrosion process involves reactions between the \ntube metal, metal oxides and gaseous chlorine species, \nultimately forming iron oxide corrosion.\nThe presence of sulfur can deter the chlorine corrosion \nmechanisms. However, woody biomass ash tends to be \nlow in sulfur. An increase in the fuel’s sulfur content \nwould decrease the corrosion rate by making the ash more \nstable and harder to melt. Sulfur injection may be used \nto mitigate chlorine corrosion. The Babcock & Wilcox \nCompany (B&W) has a sulfur recirculation technology \nfor waste-to-energy applications.\nCorrosion rates can be controlled by limiting tube \nsurface temperatures. A superheater design that limits \nthe tube metal temperatures will be less affected by \ncorrosion. Parallel and counter flow superheater bank \narrangements are used to control tube metal tempera­\ntures. Select banks will require corrosion resistant tube \nmaterials. Tube metallurgies high in chromium and \nnickel, typically FeCrNi alloys containing between 20 \nand 28% Cr, are the most corrosion resistant.\nErosion\nBiomass ash contains erosive constituents and may \ncontain tramp material. Erosion rates are affected by \nparticulate loading and gas velocity. When biomass is \nharvested, it is often delivered to the power plant with \ndirt, sand and tramp metal. Some of this material may \nbe fed to the boiler. On new units, erosion is controlled \nby limiting gas velocities to 50 ft/s (15.2 m/s). This limit \ncompensates for fuel variability and upset operating \nconditions. Biomass fuel switch retrofits typically target \n60 ft/s (18.3 m/s) with outage inspection recommendations \nfor high gas velocity banks, flues, fans and equipment \nupstream of particulate capture devices.\nUncontrolled emissions\nThe combustion process produces hot gases and \nparticulate commensurate with the fuel’s constituents, \ncombustion equipment, stoichiometry and furnace con­\nfiguration. The products of combustion must be controlled \nto permitted values. Estimates of uncontrolled NOx, CO \nand sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions provide insight for fuel, \ncombustion technology and post-combustion emissions \ncontrol decisions.\nBiomass-generated NOx emissions are low compared \nwith those from fossil fuels. Combustion temperatures are \nsufficiently low and little thermal NOx is formed from the \nnitrogen in the combustion air. NOx emissions are there­\nfore predominantly a function of the fuel nitrogen content. \n(See Chapter 33.) Conversion of fuel-bound nitrogen to \nNOx is dependent on a number of operating conditions \nincluding excess air, air staging, heat release rate, fuel \nsizing and moisture content. All factors considered, \nNOx emissions from grate firing of most woody biomass \ntypically vary between 0.2 and 0.35 lb/106 Btu (260 to 460 \nmg/Nm3 at 6% O2) heat input. Fuel contaminants that \nintroduce nitrogen compounds (glues and chemicals, for \nexample) should receive special consideration.\nWoody biomass typically contains 0.0 to 0.1% elemen­\ntal sulfur on a dry basis. During the combustion process \nsome of this sulfur can be converted to gaseous SO2, but \nthe conversion ratio is typically low (10 to 30%). Because \nthe quantities of both wood sulfur and gaseous SO2 are \nnear the lower detection limit of monitoring instruments, \ncorrelation of the two is not practical. Typically, SO2 \nemissions for grate-fired biomass fuels do not exceed 0.03 \nlb/106 Btu (40 mg/Nm3 at 6% O2) heat input. Particular \nattention should be given to fuels where sulfur-bearing \ncontaminants may be present.\nCO emissions from biomass firing are usually more \nvariable. Representing incomplete combustion, CO \nis dependent on time, temperature, turbulence and \nstoichiometry considerations. At normal excess air levels, \nheating value consistency and air-fuel distribution are \nthe most predominant determinants of CO emissions. \nConditions of high or low excess air, high fuel moisture \nand reduced load (<70% of MCR) have all been demon­\nstrated to increase gaseous CO concentrations. Modern \ngrate-fired biomass units at steady operating conditions \ntypically emit CO in the range of 0.1 to 0.5 lb/106 Btu (130 \nto 650 mg/Nm3 at 6% O2) heat input.\n", "char_count": 6438, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_30", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Biomass Installations", "is_complete_section": true}}
{"chunk_id": "unit_001_page_010", "page_number": 10, "text": "30-10\nSteam 42 / Biomass Installations\nThe Babcock & Wilcox Company\nVolatile organic compounds (VOCs) are also gaseous \nproducts of incomplete combustion. As such, VOC emis­\nsions are influenced by the same factors affecting CO. \nTypically, VOC emissions while firing biomass fuels do \nnot exceed 0.05 lb/106 Btu (65 mg/Nm3 at 6% O2) heat \ninput, expressed as methane.\nAir Emissions Control Systems\nPolicymakers and regulatory agencies are advocating \nfor increasingly more stringent emissions targets. \nEmissions challenges arise due to the inherent nature \nof biomass. Biomass particle sizing, changeable moisture \nand intermittent/variable biomass input are transient \nconditions that must be addressed. Reducing NOx and \nSO2, minimizing CO through proper air-fuel balance, and \nminimizing unburned carbon through proper fuel sizing \nshould all be considered when choosing air emissions \ncontrol systems.\nMechanical dust collectors (MDC) are often installed \nafter the last boiler heat trap to collect larger sized \nparticulate. The MDC is comprised of multiple cyclone \ntubes enclosed in a casing structure. (See Chapter 32.) \nThe cyclone tubes separate the heavy particulate from \nthe lighter fraction. The heavier particulate is often \nreinjected into the furnace to improve boiler efficiency. \nMechanical dust collector efficiency typically ranges \nfrom 65 to 75% with an approximate draft loss of 2.5 to \n3.0 in. wg (0.62 to 0.75 kPa). High hardness (450 Brinell) \nabrasion resistant material is used in select areas for \nerosion protection.\nSmall particulate is captured by an electrostatic \nprecipitator (ESP) or fabric filter dust collector. Within \nan ESP, uncharged flyash is given a negative charge \nand collected on positively charged plates. A rapping \nsystem removes the collected ash. ESPs are located \ndownstream of the mechanical collector, if installed, \nand are the last particulate control device before the \nstack. (See Chapter 32.)\nBecause fluidized-bed boilers achieve better carbon \nutilization than grate-fired units, fabric filter dust \ncollectors (Chapter 32) are often used for particulate \ncapture. Fabric filters are more efficient than ESPs and \ncan also reduce other pollutants like hydrogen chloride \n(HCl) and SO2. The development of high temperature, \nhigh efficiency bag materials has broadened the use of \nfabric filter dust collectors.\nStoichiometry controls NOx. A staged combustion \nair system provides approximately 15 to 25% NOx \nreduction. Historically, post-combustion NOx control \non biomass boilers (if required) was achieved with \nselective noncatalytic reduction (SNCR) technology. \n(See Chapter 33.) The SNCR process injects a reagent \ninto the furnace at a 1600 to 1900F (871 to 1038C) gas \ntemperature window to reduce uncontrolled NOx while \nproducing water vapor and nitrogen. There are limits \nto the amount of NOx reduction achievable with SNCR \nsystems. Reagent mixing and residence time (within the \nnecessary temperature window) are critical for obtaining \ndesired NOx reduction levels while limiting the unreacted \nammonia leaving the furnace (defined as ammonia slip).\nSelective catalytic reduction (SCR) technology (Chapter \n33) can achieve higher NOx reduction with lower ammonia \nslip than SNCR systems. The conventional high dust SCR \narrangement common on PC-fired units injects ammonia \nin a 600 to 750F (316 to 399C) temperature window \nupstream of a catalyst surface. The ammonia reacts \nwith the NOx to produce water vapor and nitrogen. SCR \ncatalyst may deactivate due to biomass flyash poisoning \nand unburned carbon carryover. For this reason, high \ndust SCRs are uncommon on biomass-fired units. An \nalternative arrangement is to place the SCR downstream \nof a particulate collection device as shown in Fig. 11.\nWoody biomass has low sulfur content, and inherent \nwood ash alkalis provide some SO2 and HCl emissions \nreduction. But some biomass can have relatively high \nsulfur and chlorine contents. In this case, SO2 control can \nbe accomplished with dry sorbent injection. (See Chapter \n34.) As an added benefit, excess SO2 reagent reduces HCl \nemissions given the correct temperature window. The use \nof a fabric filter dust collector enhances SO2 and acid gas \nremoval due to the intimate gas-to-solids contact created \nwithin the filter cake.\n", "char_count": 4325, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_30", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Biomass Installations", "is_complete_section": true}}
