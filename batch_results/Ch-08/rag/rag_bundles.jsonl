These \nvessels may require tons of structural steel for their sup­\nport. Steam generating and emissions control equipment, \nfor example, may be comprised of pressure parts ranging \nfrom small diameter tubing to vessels weighing more than \n1000 t (907 tm). A large fossil fuel boiler may extend 300 \nft (91.4 m) above the ground, requiring a steel support \nstructure comparable to a 30-story building. To assure \nreliability, a thorough design analysis of pressure parts \nand their supporting structural components is required.\nPressure Vessel Design and Analysis\nSteam generating units require pressure vessel \ncomponents that operate at internal pressures of up to \n4000 psi (27.6 MPa) and at steam temperatures above \n1100F (566C). Efforts are under way to reach even \nhigher temperature and pressure conditions in advanced \nsystem designs. Maximum reliability can be assured \nonly with a thorough stress analysis of the components. \nTherefore, considerable attention is given to the design \nand stress analysis of steam drums, superheater headers, \nheat exchangers, pressurizers and nuclear reactors. In \ndesigning these vessels, the basic approach is to account \nfor all unknown factors such as local yielding and stress \nredistribution, variability in material properties, inexact \nknowledge of loadings, and inexact stress evaluations by \nusing allowable working stresses that include appropriate \nsafety factors.\nThe analysis and design of complex pressure vessels \nand components, such as the reactor closure head shown \nin Fig. 1, and the fossil boiler steam drum shown in Fig. \n2, require sophisticated principles and methods. Math­\nematical equations based on the theory of elasticity are \napplied to regions of discontinuities, nozzle openings and \nsupports. Advanced computerized structural mechanics \nmethods, such as the finite element method, are used to \ndetermine complex vessel stresses.\nIn the United States (U.S.), pressure vessel construc­\ntion codes adopted by state, federal and municipal \nauthorities establish safety requirements for vessel \nconstruction. The most widely used code is the American \nSociety of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and \nPressure Vessel Code. Key sections include Section I, Rules \nfor Construction of Power Boilers; Section III, Rules for \nConstruction of Nuclear Power Plant Components; and \nSection VIII, Rules for Construction of Pressure Vessels. \nA further introduction to the ASME Code is presented \nin Appendix 2.\nChapter 8\nStructural Analysis and Design\nFig. 1  Nuclear reactor vessel closure head.\nStress significance\nStress is defined as the internal force between two \nadjacent elements of a body, divided by the area over \nwhich it is applied. The main significance of a stress is its \nmagnitude; however, the nature of the applied load and \nthe resulting stress distribution are also important. The \ndesigner must consider whether the loading is mechanical \nor thermal, whether it is steady-state or transient, and \nwhether the stress pattern is uniform.\nStress distribution depends on the material properties. \nFor example, yielding or strain readjustment can cause \nredistribution of stresses.\nSteady-state conditions  An excessive steady-state \nstress due to applied pressure results in vessel mate­\nrial distortion, progresses to leakage at fittings, and \nultimately causes failure in a ductile vessel. To prevent \nthis type of failure a safety factor is applied to the material \nproperties.

ASME Codes \nestablish pressure vessel design safety factors based on \nthe sophistication of quality assurance, manufacturing \ncontrol, and design analysis techniques.\nTransient conditions  When the applied stresses are \nrepetitive, such as those occurring during testing and \ntransient operation, they may limit the fatigue life of the \nvessel. The designer must consider transient conditions \ncausing fatigue stresses in addition to those caused by \nsteady-state forces.\nAlthough vessels must have nozzles, supports and \nflanges, these features often embody abrupt changes in \ncross-section. These changes can introduce irregularities \nin the overall stress pattern called local or peak stresses. \nOther construction details can also promote stress con­\ncentrations which, in turn, affect the vessel’s fatigue life.\nStrength theories\nSeveral material strength theories are used to \ndetermine when failure will occur under the action of \nmulti-axial stresses on the basis of data obtained from \nuni-axial tension or compression tests. The three most \ncommonly applied theories which are used to establish \nelastic design stress limits are the maximum (principal) \nstress theory, the maximum shear stress theory, and the \ndistortion energy theory.\nMaximum stress theory  The maximum stress theory \nconsiders failure to occur when one of the three principal \nstresses (s) reaches the material yield point (sy.p.) in \ntension:\n\t\n\t\n(1)\n This theory is the simplest to apply and, with an \nadequate safety factor, it results in safe, reliable pressure \nvessel designs. This is the theory of strength used in \nthe ASME Code, Section I, Section VIII Division 1, and \nSection III Division 1 (design by formula Subsections \nNC-3300, ND-3300 and NE-3300).\nσ\nσ\n=\ny.p.\nMaximum shear stress theory  The maximum shear \nstress theory, also known as the Tresca theory,1 considers \nfailure to occur when the maximum shear stress reaches \nthe maximum shear stress at the yield strength of the \nmaterial in tension. Noting that the maximum shear \nstress (t) is equal to half the difference of the maximum \nand minimum principal stresses, and that the maximum \nshear stress in a tension test specimen is half the axial \nprincipal stress, the condition for yielding becomes:\n\t\n\t\n(2)\nThe value 2t is called the shear stress intensity. The \nmaximum shear stress theory predicts ductile mate­\nrial yielding more accurately than the maximum stress \ntheory. This is the theory of strength used in the ASME \nCode, Section VIII Division 2, and Section III Division \n1, Subsection NB, and design by analysis Subsections \nNC-3200 and NE-3200.\nDistortion energy theory  The distortion energy \ntheory (also known as the Mises criterion1) considers \nyielding to occur when the distortion energy at a point \nin a stressed element is equal to the distortion energy in \na uni-axial test specimen at the point it begins to yield. \nWhile the distortion energy theory is the most accurate \nfor ductile materials, it is cumbersome to use and is not \nroutinely applied in pressure vessel design codes.\nDesign criteria1\nTo determine the allowable stresses in a pressure \nvessel, one must consider the nature of the loading and \nthe vessel response to the loading. Stress interpretation \ndetermines the required stress analyses and the allowable \nstress magnitudes. Current design codes establish the \ncriteria for safe design and operation of pressure vessels.\nStress classifications  There are three major stress \nclassifications in pressure vessels: primary, secondary \nand peak.\nPrimary stresses (P) are caused by loadings which \nare necessary to satisfy the laws of equilibrium with \napplied pressure and other loads. These stresses are \nfurther divided into general primary membrane (Pm), \nlocal primary membrane (PL) and primary bending (Pb) \nstresses. A primary stress is not self-limiting, i.e., if the \nmaterial yields or is deformed, the stress is not reduced. \nA good example of this type of stress is that produced \nby internal pressure such as in a steam drum. When it \nexceeds the vessel material yield strength, permanent \ndistortion appears and failure may occur.\nSecondary stresses (Q), due to mechanical loads or \ndifferential thermal expansion, are developed by the \nconstraint of adjacent material or adjacent components. \nThey are self-limiting and are usually confined to local \nareas of the vessel. Local yielding or minor distortion can \nreduce secondary stresses. Although they do not affect the \nstatic bursting strength of a vessel, secondary stresses \nmust be considered in establishing its fatigue life.\nPeak stresses (F) are concentrated in highly localized \nareas at abrupt geometry changes.

This stress, limited to \nthe allowable material tension stress S, is calculated at \nthe vessel design temperature. The Section I regulations \nhave been established to ensure that secondary and peak \nstresses are minimized; a detailed analysis of these \nstresses is normally not required.\nThe design criteria of ASME Code, Section VIII \nDivision 1, and Section III Division 1 (design by formula \nSubsections NC-3300, ND-3300 and NE-3300), are simi­\nlar to those of Section I. However, they require cylindrical \nshell thickness calculations in the circumferential and \nlongitudinal directions. The minimum required pressure \nvessel wall thickness is set by the maximum stress in \neither direction. Section III Division 1 and Subsections \nNC-3300 and ND-3300 permit the combination of \nprimary membrane and primary bending stresses to be \nup to 1.5 S at design temperature. Section VIII Division \n1 permits the combination of primary membrane and \nprimary bending stresses to be 1.5 S at temperatures \nwhere tensile or yield strength sets the allowable stress \nS, and a value smaller than 1.5 S at temperatures where \ncreep governs the allowable stress.\nASME Code, Section VIII Division 2 provides formulas \nand rules for common configurations of shells and formed \nheads. It also requires detailed stress analysis of complex \ngeometries with unusual or cyclic loading conditions. \nThe calculated stress intensities are assigned to specific \ncategories. The allowable stress intensity of each category \nis based on a multiplier of the Code-allowable stress \nintensity value. The Code-allowable stress intensity, \nSm, is based on the material yield strength, Sy, or tensile \nstrength, Su. (See Table 1.)\nThe factor k varies with the type of loading:\n\t\n\tk\t\n\t\nLoading\n\t\n1.0\t\nsustained\n\t\n1.2\t\nsustained and transient\n\t\n1.25\t\nhydrostatic test\n\t\n1.5\t\npneumatic test\nThe design criteria for ASME Code, Section III Divi­\nsion 1, Subsection NB and design by analysis Subsections \nNC-3200 and NE-3200 are similar to those for Section \nVIII Division 2 except there is less use of design formulas, \ncurves and tables, and greater use of design by analysis in \nSection III. The categories of stresses and stress intensity \nlimits are the same in both sections.\nStress analysis methods\nStress analysis of pressure vessels can be performed \nby analytical or experimental methods. An analytical \nmethod, involving a rigorous mathematical solution based \non the theory of elasticity and plasticity, is the most direct \nand inexpensive approach when the problem is adaptable \nto such a solution. When the problem is too complex for this \nmethod, approximate analytical structural mechanics \nmethods, such as finite element analysis, are applied. If \nthe problem is beyond analytical solutions, experimental \nmethods must be used.\nMathematical formulas2  Pressure vessels are com­\nmonly spheres, cylinders, ellipsoids, tori or composites \nof these. When the wall thickness is small compared to \nother dimensions, vessels are referred to as membrane \nshells. Stresses acting over the thickness of the vessel \nwall and tangential to its surface can be represented by \nmathematical formulas for the common shell forms.\nPressure stresses are classified as primary membrane \nstresses since they remain as long as the pressure is ap­\nplied to the vessel. The basic equation for the longitudinal \nstress s1, and hoop stress s2, in a vessel of thickness h, \nlongitudinal radius r1, and circumferential radius r2, \nwhich is subject to a pressure P, shown in Fig. 3 is:\n\t\n\t\n(3)\nFrom this equation, and by equating the total pressure \nload with the longitudinal forces acting on a transverse \nsection of the vessel, the stresses in the commonly used \nshells of revolution can be found.\n1.\t Cylindrical vessel – in this case, r1 = ∞, r2 = r, and\n\t\n\t\n(4)\n\t\n\t\n(5)\n2.\t Spherical vessel – in this case, r1 = r2 = r, and\n\t\n\t\n(6)\n\t\n\t\n(7)\nσ\nσ\n1\n1\n2\n2\nr\nr\nP\nh\n+\n=\nσ1\n2\n= Pr\nh\nσ 2 = Pr\nh\nσ1\n2\n= Pr\nh\nσ 2\n2\n= Pr\nh\n", "char_count": 4401, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_001", "section_id": "chapter_8", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "Structural Analysis and Design", "is_complete_section": true}}

Three aspects of a thermal analysis \nrequire an iterative solution.\nFirst, thermal material properties are temperature \ndependent. Because they are primary unknowns, \ntemperature assumptions must be made to establish the \ninitial material properties. Each node is first given an \nassumed temperature. The first thermal distribution is \nthen obtained, and the calculated temperatures are used \nin a second iteration. Convergence is attained when the \ncalculated temperature distributions from two successive \niterations are nearly the same.\nSecond, when convective heat transfer is accounted \nfor, heat transfer at a fluid boundary is dependent \non the material surface temperature. Again, because \ntemperatures are the primary unknowns, the solution \nmust be iterative.\nThird, in a transient analysis, the input parameters, \nincluding boundary conditions, may change with time, \nand the analysis must be broken into discrete steps. \nWithin each time step, the input parameters are held \nconstant. For this reason, transient thermal analysis is \nsometimes termed quasi-static.\nFEA applied to dynamic problems is based upon the \ndifferential equation of motion:\n\t\n\t\n(41)\nwhere\n[M]\t=\t structure lumped mass matrix\n[C]\t =\t structure damping matrix\n[K]\t =\t structure stiffness matrix\n{R}\t =\t column of nodal forcing functions\n{D},{  } and {  } are columns of nodal displacements, \nvelocities and accelerations, respectively.\nVariations on Equation 41 can be used to solve for the \nnatural frequencies, mode shapes and responses due to a \nforcing function (periodic or nonperiodic), or to perform \na dynamic seismic analysis.\nLimitations of FEA involve computer and human \nresources. The user must have substantial experience \nand, among other abilities, must be skilled in selecting \nelement types and in geometry modeling.\nIn FEA, result accuracy increases with the number \nof nodes and elements. However, computation time \nalso increases and handling the mass of data can be \ncumbersome.\nIn most finite element analyses, large-scale yielding \n(plastic strain) and deformations (including buckling \ninstability), and creep are not accounted for; the material \nis considered to be linear elastic. In a linear structural \nanalysis, the response (stress, strain, etc.) is proportional \nto the load. For example, if the applied load is doubled, \nthe stress response would also double. For nonlinear \nanalysis, FEA can also be beneficial. Advancements in \ncomputer hardware and software have enabled increased \nuse of nonlinear analysis techniques.\nAlthough most FEA software has well developed \nthree-dimensional capabilities, some pressure vessel \nanalyses are imprecise due to a lack of acceptance criteria.\nComputer software consists of commercially available \nand proprietary FEA programs. This software can be \ncategorized into three groups: 1) preprocessors, 2) finite \nM\nD\nC\nD\nK\nD\nR\n\n{ } + { } + \n{ } = { }\n\n\nD\nD\nelement solvers, and 3) postprocessors.\nA preprocessor builds a model geometry and applies \nboundary conditions, then verifies and optimizes the \nmodel. The output of a finite element solver consists \nof displacements, stresses, temperatures, or dynamic \nresponse data.\nPostprocessors manipulate the output from the finite \nelement solver for comparison to acceptance criteria or \nto make contour map plots.\nApplication of FEA  Because classical formulas and \nshell analysis solutions are limited to simple shapes, \nFEA fills a technical void and is applied in response \nto ASME Code requirements. A large portion of The \nBabcock & Wilcox Company’s (B&W) FEA supports \npressure vessel design. Stresses can be calculated near \nnozzles and other abrupt geometry changes. In addition, \ntemperature changes and the resulting thermal stresses \ncan be predicted using FEA.\nThe raw output from a finite element solver cannot be \ndirectly applied to the ASME Code criteria. The stresses \nor strains must first be classified as membrane, bending \nor peak. (See Fig. 9.) B&W pioneered the classification \nof finite element stresses and these procedures are now \nused throughout the industry.\nPiping flexibility, for example, is an ideal FEA applica­\ntion. In addition, structural steel designers rely on FEA \nto analyze complex frame systems that support steam \ngeneration and emissions control equipment.\nFinite element analysis is often used for preliminary \nreview of new product designs. For example, Fig. 10 shows \nthe deflected shape of two economizer fin configurations \nmodeled using FEA.\nFracture mechanics methods\nFracture mechanics provides analysis methods to \naccount for the presence of flaws such as voids or cracks. \nThis is in contrast to the stress analysis methods \ndiscussed earlier in which the structure was considered \nto be free of those kinds of defects. Flaws may be found \nby nondestructive examination (NDE) or they may be \nhypothesized prior to fabrication.

Additionally, it is well suited to the prediction of \nthe remaining life of components under cyclic fatigue and \nhigh temperature creep conditions.\nDuring component design, the flaw size is hypoth­\nesized. Allowable design stresses can be determined \nknowing the lower bound material toughness from \naccepted design procedures in conjunction with a factor \nof safety.\nFracture mechanics can be used to evaluate the \nintegrity of a flawed existing structure. The defect, \nusually found by NDE, is idealized according to accepted \nASME practices. An analysis uses design or calculated \nstresses based on real or hypothesized loads, and material \nproperties are found from testing a specimen of similar \nmaterial. Determining allowable flaw sizes strongly relies \non accurate material properties and the best estimates of \nstructural stresses. Appropriate safety factors are then \nadded to the calculations.\nDuring inspection of power plant components, \nminor cracks or flaws may be discovered. However, the \nflaws may propagate by creep or fatigue and become \nsignificant. The remaining life of components cannot be \naccurately predicted from stress/cycles to failure (s/N) \ncurves alone. These predictions become possible using \nfracture mechanics.\nLinear elastic fracture mechanics  The basic concept\nof linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) was \noriginally developed to quantitatively evaluate sudden \nstructural failure. LEFM, based on an analysis of the \nstresses near a sharp crack, assumes elastic behavior \nthroughout the structure. The stress distribution near \nthe crack tip depends on a single quantity, termed the \nstress intensity factor, KI. LEFM assumes that unstable \npropagation of existing flaws occurs when the stress \nintensity factor becomes critical; this critical value is the \nfracture toughness of the material, KIC.\nThe theory of LEFM, is based on the assumption that, \nat fracture, stress s and defect size a are related to the \nfracture toughness KIC, as follows:\n\t\n\t\n(42a)\nK\nC\na\nI =\nσ\nπ\nand\n\t\n\t\n(42b)\nThe critical material property, KIC, is compared to \nthe stress intensity factor of the cracked structure, KI, \nto identify failure potential. KI should not be confused \nwith the stress intensity used elsewhere in ASME design \ncodes for analysis of unflawed structures. The term C, \naccounting for the geometry of the crack and structure, \nis a function of the crack size and relevant structure \ndimensions such as width or thickness.\nC is exactly 1.0 for an infinitely wide center cracked \npanel with a through-wall crack length 2a, loaded in \ntension by a uniform remote stress s. The factor C varies \nfor other crack geometries illustrated in Fig. 11. Defects in \na structure due to manufacture, in-service environment, \nor in-service cyclic fatigue are usually assumed to be flat, \nsharp, planar discontinuities where the planar area is \nnormal to the applied stress.\nASME Code procedures for fracture mechanics design/\nanalysis are presently given in Sections III and XI which \nare used for component thicknesses of at least 4 in. (102 \nmm) for ferritic materials with yield strengths less than \n50,000 psi (344.7 MPa) and for simple geometries and \nstress distributions. The basic concepts of the Code may \nbe extended to other ferritic materials (including clad \nferritic materials) and more complex geometries; however, \nit does not apply to austenitic or high nickel alloys. These \nprocedures provide methods for designing against brittle \nfractures in structures and for evaluating the significance \nof flaws found during in-service inspections.\nThe ASME Code, Section III uses the principles of \nlinear elastic fracture mechanics to determine allowable \nloadings in ferritic pressure vessels with an assumed \ndefect.

The temperature \nshift procedure accounts for heat-to-heat variation in \nmaterial toughness properties.\n5.\t Using the procedures above, as well as a procedure \nfor calculating cumulative fatigue crack growth, \nthree critical flaw parameters are determined:\naf\t\n=\t\nmaximum size to which the detected flaw \n\t\n\t\ncan grow during the remaining service of the \n\t\n\t\ncomponent                                                                         \nacrit\t =\t\nmaximum critical size of the detected flaw\n\t\n\t\nunder normal conditions                                                         \nainit\t =\t\nmaximum critical size for nonarresting \n\t\n\t\ngrowth initiation of the observed flaw under \n\t\n\t\nemergency and faulted conditions\n6.\t Using these critical flaw parameters, determine if \nthe detected flaw meets the following conditions for \ncontinued operation:\n\t\n\t\n(43)\nElastic-plastic fracture mechanics (EPFM)  LEFM \nprovides a one-parameter failure criterion in terms of \na\na\na\na\nf\ncrit\nf\ninit\n<\n<\n0 1\n0 5\n.\n.\nthe crack tip stress intensity factor (KI), but is limited \nto analyses where the plastic region surrounding the \ncrack tip is small compared to the overall component \ndimensions.

This param­\neter, the path independent J-integral, can characterize \nLEFM, EPFM, and fully plastic fracture mechanics. It \nis capable of characterizing crack initiation, growth and \ninstability.

These \ndiagrams recognize both brittle fracture and net section \ncollapse mechanisms. The failure diagram (see Fig. 12) \nis a safety/failure plane defined by the stress intensity \nfactor/toughness ratio (Kr) as the ordinate and the applied \nstress/net section plastic collapse stress ratio (Sr) as the \nabscissa. For a fixed applied stress and defect size, the \ncoordinates Kr, Sr are readily calculable. If the assessment \npoint denoted by these coordinates lies inside the failure \nassessment curve, no crack growth can occur. If the \nassessment point lies outside the curve, unstable crack \ngrowth is predicted.

If the resulting assessment point lies inside \nthe failure assessment curve, the crack will leak before \nan unstable crack growth occurs.\nThe deformation plasticity failure assessment diagram \n(DPFAD)5 is a specific variation of a failure assessment \ndiagram. DPFAD follows the British PD 6493 R-6 format,6 \nand incorporates EPFM deformation plasticity J-integral \nsolutions. The DPFAD curve is determined by normal­\nizing the deformation plasticity J-integral response of \nthe flawed structure by its elastic response. The square \nroot of this ratio is denoted by Kr. The Sr coordinate is \nthe ratio of the applied stress to the net section plastic \ncollapse stress. Various computer programs are available \nwhich automate this process for application purposes.\nSubcritical crack growth  Subcritical crack growth \nrefers to crack propagation due to cyclic fatigue, stress \ncorrosion cracking, creep crack growth or a combination \nof the three. Stress corrosion cracking and creep crack \ngrowth are time based while fatigue crack growth is based \non the number of stress cycles.\nFatigue crack growth  Metal fatigue, although studied \nfor more than 100 years, continues to plague structures \nsubjected to cyclic stresses. The traditional approach to \nprevent fatigue failures is to base the allowable fatigue \nstresses on test results of carefully made laboratory \nspecimens or representative structural components. \nThese results are usually presented in cyclic stress versus \ncycles to failure, or s/N, curves.\nThe significant events of metal fatigue are crack \ninitiation and subsequent growth until the net section \nyields or until the stress intensity factor of the structure \nexceeds the material resistance to fracture. Traditional \nanalysis assumes that a structure is initially crack free. \nHowever, a structure can have cracks that originate \nduring fabrication or during operation. Therefore, fatigue \ncrack growth calculations are required to predict the \nservice life of a structure.\nFatigue crack growth calculations can 1) determine the \nservice life of a flawed structure that (during its lifetime) \nundergoes significant in-service cyclic loading, or 2) \ndetermine the initial flaw size that can be tolerated prior \nto or during a specified operating period of the structure.\nThe most useful way of presenting fatigue crack \ngrowth rates is to consider them as a function of the stress \nintensity difference, DK, which is the difference between \nthe maximum and minimum stress intensity factors.\nTo calculate fatigue crack growth, an experimentally \ndetermined curve such as Fig. 13 is used. The vertical \naxis, da/dN, is the crack growth per cycle. ASME Code, \nSection XI contains similar growth rate curves for \npressure vessel steels.\nCreep crack growth  Predicting the remaining life \nof fossil power plant components from creep rupture \ndata alone is not reliable. Cracks can develop at critical \nlocations and these cracks can then propagate by creep \ncrack growth.\nAt temperatures above 800F (427C), creep crack \ngrowth can cause structural components to fail. \nOperating temperatures for certain fossil power plant \ncomponents range from 900 to more than 1100F (482 \nto 593C). At these temperatures, creep deformation \nand crack growth become dependent on strain rate and \ntime exposure. Macroscopic crack growth in a creeping \nmaterial occurs by nucleation and joining of microcavities \nin the highly strained region ahead of the crack tip. In \ntime dependent fracture mechanics (TDFM), the energy \nrelease rate (power) parameter Ct correlates creep crack \ngrowth through the relationship:7\nFig. 12  Deformation plasticity failure assessment diagram in terms of \nstable crack growth.\nFig. 13  Relationship between da/dN and DK as plotted on logarithmic \ncoordinates.\n", "char_count": 3938, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_005", "section_id": "chapter_9", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "{ }", "is_complete_section": true}}

The constants \nb and q are determined by a curve fit technique. Under \nsteady-state creep where the crack tip stresses no longer \nchange with time, the crack growth can be characterized \nsolely by the path independent energy rate line integral \nC*, analogous to the J-integral.\nC* and Ct can both be interpreted as the difference \nin energy rates (power) between two bodies with \nincrementally differing crack lengths. Furthermore, C* \ncharacterizes the strength of the crack tip stress singular­\nity in the same manner as the J-integral characterizes \nthe elastic-plastic stress singularity.\nThe fully plastic deformation solutions from EPRI4 can \nthen be used to estimate the creep crack tip steady-state \nparameter, C*. \nSignificant data support Ct as a parameter for correlat­\ning creep crack growth behavior represented by Equation \n47. An approximate expression for Ct is as follows:8\n\t\n\t\n(48)\nwhere tT is the transition time given by:\n\t\n\t\n(49)\nand m is Poisson’s ratio, and n is the secondary creep \nrate exponent.\nFor continuous operation, Equation 48 is integrated \nover the time covering crack growth from the initial \nflaw size to the final flaw size.

For this calculation, fracture toughness data such \nas KIC, JIC or the JR curve would be used in a failure \nassessment diagram approach to determine the limiting \nfinal flaw size.\nConstruction features\nAll pressure vessels require construction features such \nas fluid inlets and outlets, access openings, and structural \nattachments at support locations. These shell areas must \nhave adequate reinforcement and gradual geometric \ntransitions which limit local stresses to acceptable levels.\nOpenings  Openings are the most prevalent construc-\ntion features on a vessel. They can become areas of \nweakness and may lead to unacceptable local distortion, \nknown as bell mouthing, when the vessel is pressurized. \nSuch distortions are associated with high local membrane \nstresses around the opening. Analytical studies have \nshown that these high stresses are confined to a distance \nof approximately one hole diameter, d, along the shell from \nthe axis of the opening and are limited to a distance of \n0.37 (dtnozzle)1/2  normal to the shell.\nReinforcement to reduce the membrane stress near \nan opening can be provided by increasing the vessel \nwall thickness. An alternate, more economical stress \nreduction method is to thicken the vessel locally around \nthe nozzle axis of symmetry.

Designs \na and b, combined with generous radii r, are most suitable \nfor cyclic load applications.\nThe ligament efficiency method is also used to \ncompensate for metal removed at shell openings. This \nmethod considers the load carrying ability of an area \nbetween two points in relation to the load carrying ability \nof the remaining ligament when the two points become \nthe centers of two openings. The ASME Code guidelines \nused in this method only apply to cylindrical pressure \nvessels where the circumferential stress is twice the \nlongitudinal stress. In determining the thickness of such \nvessels, the allowable stress in the thickness calculation \nis multiplied by the ligament efficiency.\nNozzle and attachment loadings  When external load-\nings are applied to nozzles or attachment components, \nlocal stresses are generated in the shell. Several types \nof loading may be applied, such as sustained, transient \nand thermal expansion flexibility loadings. The local \nmembrane stresses produced by such loadings must be \nlimited to avoid unacceptable distortion due to a single \nload application. The combination of local membrane \nand bending stresses must also be limited to avoid \nincremental distortion under cyclic loading. Finally, to \nprevent cyclic load fatigue failures, the nozzle or attach­\nment should include gradual transitions which minimize \nstress concentrations.\nPressure vessels may require local thickening at \nnozzles and attachments to avoid yielding or incremental \ndistortion due to the combined effects of external \nloading, internal pressure, and thermal loading. Simple \nprocedures to determine such reinforcement are not avail­\nable, however FEA methods can be used. The Welding \nResearch Council (WRC) Bulletin No. 107 also provides \na procedure for determining local stresses adjacent to \nnozzles and rectangular attachments on cylindrical and \nspherical shells.\nThe external loadings considered by the WRC are \nlongitudinal moment, transverse moment, torsional \nmoment, and axial force. Stresses at various inside and \noutside shell surfaces are obtained by combining the \nstresses from the various applied loads. These external \nload stresses are then combined with internal pressure \nstresses and compared with allowable stress limits.\nUse of the WRC procedure is restricted by limita­\ntions on shell and attachment parameters; however, \nexperimental and theoretical work continues in this area.\nStructural Support Components\nPressure vessels are normally supported by saddles, \ncylindrical support skirts, hanger lugs and brackets, \nring girders, or integral support legs. A vessel has con­\ncentrated loads imposed on its shell where these supports \nare located. Therefore, it is important that the support \narrangements minimize local stresses in the vessel. In \naddition, the components must provide support for the \nspecified loading conditions and withstand corresponding \ntemperature requirements.\nDesign criteria\nStructural elements that provide support, stiffening, \nand/or stabilization of pressure vessels or components \nmay be directly attached by welding or bolting. They \ncan also be indirectly attached by clips, pins or clamps, \nor may be completely unattached thereby transferring \nload through surface bearing and friction.\nLoading conditions  In general, loads applied to \nstructural components are categorized as dead, live or \ntransient loads. Dead loads are due to the force of gravity \non the equipment and supports. Live loads vary in mag­\nnitude and are applied to produce the maximum design \nconditions. Transient loads are time dependent and are \nexpected to occur randomly for the life of the structural \ncomponents. Specific loadings that are considered in \ndesigning a pressure component support include:\n1.\t weight of the component and its contents during \noperating and test conditions, including loads due to \nstatic and dynamic head and fluid flow,\n2.\t weight of the support components,\n3.\t superimposed static and thermal loads induced by the \nsupported components,\n4.\t environmental loads such as wind and snow,\n5.\t dynamic loads including those caused by earthquake, \nvibration, or rapid pressure change,\n6.\t loads from piping thermal expansion,\n7.\t loads from expansion or contraction due to pressure, \nand\n8.\t loads due to anchor settlement.\nCode design/analysis requirements  Code require­\nments for designing pressure part structural supports \nvary. The ASME Code, Section I, only covers pressure \npart attaching lugs, hangers or brackets. These must \nbe properly fitted and must be made of weldable and \ncomparable quality material. Only the weld attaching \nthe structural member to the pressure part is considered \nwithin the scope of Section I. Prudent design of all other \nsupport hardware is the manufacturer’s responsibility.\nThe ASME Code, Section VIII Division 1, does not \ncontain design requirements for vessel supports; however, \nsuggested rules of good practice are presented. These \nrules primarily address support details which prevent \nexcessive local shell stresses at the attachments. For \nexample, horizontal pressure vessel support saddles are \nrecommended to support at least one-third of the shell \ncircumference. Rules for the saddle design are not covered. \nHowever, the Code refers the designer to the Manual of \nSteel Construction, published by the American Institute \nof Steel Construction (AISC). This reference details the \nallowable stress design (ASD) method for structural \nsteel building designs. When adjustments are made for \nelevated temperatures, this specification can be used for \ndesigning pressure vessel support components. Similarly, \nSection VIII Division 2 does not contain design methods \nfor vessel support components. However, materials for \nstructural attachments welded to pressure components \nand details of permissible attachment welds are covered.\nSection III of the ASME Code contains rules for the \nmaterial, design, fabrication, examination and installa­\ntion of certain pressure component and piping supports. \nThe supports are placed within three categories:\n1.\t plate and shell type supports, such as vessel skirts \nand saddles, which are fabricated from plate and \nshell elements,\n", "char_count": 6457, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_006", "section_id": "chapter_13", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "(", "is_complete_section": true}}

The length of the support is chosen to permit \nthis bending to occur safely. See Fig. 15 for typical shell \ntype support skirt details.\nIn designing the skirt, the magnitudes of the loads \nthat must be supported are determined.

Finally, \nskirt connections at the vessel and support base must be \nchecked for local primary and secondary bending stresses. \nThe consideration of overall stress levels provides the \nmost accurate design.\nLocal thermal bending stresses often occur because of \na temperature difference between the skirt and support \nbase. The magnitudes of these bending stresses are de­\npendent upon the severity of this axial thermal gradient; \nsteeper gradients promote higher stresses.
