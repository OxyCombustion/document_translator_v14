These losses occur at constant flow \nwhere there are variations in flow channel cross-sectional \narea and where the inlet and outlet are at different \nelevations. Fluid friction and, in some cases heat transfer \nwith the surroundings, also have important effects on \npressure and velocity in a flowing fluid. The following \ndiscussion applies to fluids flowing in channels without \na free surface. \nWhen a fluid flows, molecular diffusion causes \nmomentum interchanges between layers of the fluid that \nare moving at different velocities. These interchanges \nare not limited to individual molecules. In most flow \nsituations there are also bulk fluid interchanges known as \neddy diffusion. The net result of all inelastic momentum \nexchanges is exhibited in shear stresses between adjacent \nlayers of the fluid. If the fluid is contained in a flow \nchannel, these stresses are eventually transmitted to \nthe walls of the channel. To counterbalance this wall \nshear stress, a pressure gradient proportional to the bulk \nkinetic energy, V 2/2gc, is established in the fluid in the \ndirection of the bulk flow.

Examination of \nFig. 1 shows that flow is laminar at Reynolds numbers less \nthan 2000, generally turbulent at values exceeding 4000, \nand completely turbulent at higher values. Indeterminate \nconditions exist in the critical zone between Reynolds \nnumbers of 2000 and 4000.\nFluid flow can be described by a system of simultaneous \npartial differential equations.

However, due to the complexity of \nthese equations, solutions are generally only available \nfor the case of laminar flow, where the only momentum \nchanges are on a molecular basis.

Converging boundar­\nies can stabilize flow during the change from pressure \nenergy to kinetic energy, and local irrecoverable flow \nlosses (inelastic momentum exchanges) can be practically \neliminated with proper design. If the included angle of the \nconverging boundaries is 30 deg (0.52 rad) or less and the \nterminal junctions are smooth and tangent, any losses in \nmechanical energy are largely due to fluid friction. It is \nnecessary to consider this loss as 0.05 times the velocity \nhead, based on the smaller downstream flow area.\nWhen the elevation change (Z2 - Z1) is zero, the \nmechanical energy balance for converging boundaries \nbecomes:\n\t\n\t\n(53)\nSubscripts 1 and 2 identify the upstream and downstream \nsections. The contraction loss factor, Nc, is the number of \nvelocity heads lost by friction and local nonrecoverable \npressure loss in contraction. Fig. 6 shows values of this \nfactor.\nWhen there is an enlargement of the conduit section \nin the direction of flow, the expansion of the flow stream \nis proportional to the kinetic energy of the flowing \nfluid and is subject to a pressure loss depending on the \ngeometry. Just as in the case of the contraction loss, this \nis an irreversible energy conversion to heat resulting from \ninelastic momentum exchanges.

The pressure differences are \nshown in terms of the velocity head at the smaller area \nplotted against section area ratios.\nFlow through bends\nBends in a pipeline or duct system produce pressure \nlosses caused by both fluid friction and momentum \nexchanges which result from a change in flow direction. \nBecause the axial length of the bend is normally included \nin the straight length friction loss of the pipeline or duct \nsystem, it is convenient to subtract a calculated equivalent \nstraight length friction loss from experimentally \ndetermined bend pressure loss factors.

The combined effect of radius ratio and bend \nangle, in terms of velocity heads, is shown in Fig. 9.\nFlow through rectangular ducts\nThe loss of pressure caused by a direction change in a \nrectangular duct system is similar to that for cylindrical \npipe. However, an additional factor, the shape of the duct \nin relation to the direction of bend, must be taken into \naccount. This is called the aspect ratio, which is defined \nas the ratio of the width to the depth of the duct, i.e., the \nratio b/d in Fig. 10. The bend loss for the same radius \nratio decreases as the aspect ratio increases because of \nthe smaller proportionate influence of secondary flows \non the stream. The combined effect of radius and aspect \nratios on 90 deg (1.57 rad) duct bends is given in terms \nof velocity heads in Fig. 10.\nThe loss factors shown in Fig. 10 are average values of \ntest results on ducts. For the given range of aspect ratios, \nthe losses are relatively independent of the Reynolds \nnumber. Outside this range, the variation with Reynolds \nnumber is erratic. It is therefore recommended that Nb \nvalues for b/d = 0.5 be used for all aspect ratios less than \nb/d = 0.5, and values for b/d = 2.0 be used for ratios greater \nthan b/d = 2.0. Losses for bends other than 90 deg (1.57 \nrad) are customarily considered to be proportional to the \nbend angle.\nTurning vanes\nThe losses in a rectangular elbow duct can be reduced \nby rounding or beveling its corners and by installing \nturning vanes. With rounding or beveling, the overall \nsize of the duct can become large; however, with turning \nvanes, the compact form of the duct is preserved.\nA number of turning vane shapes can be used in a duct. \nFig. 11 shows four different arrangements. Segmented \nFig. 7  Enlargement loss factor for various included angles.\nshaped vanes are shown in Fig. 11a, simple curved thin \nvanes are shown in Fig. 11b, and concentric splitter \nvanes are shown in Fig. 11c. In Fig. 11c, the vanes are \nconcentric with the radius of the duct. Fig. 11d illustrates \nsimple vanes used to minimize flow separation from a \nsquare edged duct.\nThe turning vanes of identical shape and dimension, \nFig. 11b, are usually mounted within the bend of an elbow. \nThey are generally installed along a line or section of the \nduct and are placed from the inner corner to the outside \ncorner of the bend. Concentric turning vanes, Fig. 11c, \ntypically installed within the bend of the turn, are located \nfrom one end of the turn to the other end.\nThe purpose of the turning vanes in an elbow or turn \nis to deflect the flow around the bend to the inner wall \nof the duct. When the turning vanes are appropriately \ndesigned, the flow distribution is improved by reducing \nflow separation from the walls and reducing the formation \nof eddy zones in the downstream section of the bend. The \nvelocity distribution over the downstream cross-section \nof the turn is improved (see Fig. 12), and the pressure \nloss of the turn or elbow is decreased.\nFig. 8  Static pressure difference resulting from sudden and gradual \nchanges in section.\n", "char_count": 3158, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_003", "section_id": "chapter_4", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "(", "is_complete_section": true}}

Finally, large changes in average mixture density \nat different locations significantly impact the static head. \nThese factors are presented in detail in Chapter 5.\nEntrainment by Fluid Flow\nCollecting or transporting solid particles or a second \nfluid by the flow of a primary fluid at high velocity is \nknown as entrainment. This is usually accomplished with \njets using a small quantity of high pressure fluid to carry \nlarge quantities of another fluid or solid particles. The \npressure energy of the high pressure fluid is converted \ninto kinetic energy by nozzles, with a consequent reduc­\ntion of pressure. The material to be transported is drawn \nin at the low pressure zone, where it meets and mixes \nwith the high velocity jet. The jet is usually followed by \na parallel throat section to equalize the velocity profile. \nThe mixture then enters a diverging section where kinetic \nenergy is partially reconverted into pressure energy. In \nthis case, major fluid flow mechanical energy losses are \nan example of inelastic momentum exchanges occurring \nwithin the fluid streams.\nThe injector is a jet pump that uses condensing \nsteam as the driving fluid to entrain low pressure \nwater for delivery against a back pressure higher than \nthe pressure of the steam supplied. The ejector, similar \nto the injector, is designed to entrain gases, liquids, or \nmixtures of solids and liquids for delivery against a pres­\nsure less than that of the primary fluid. In a water-jet \naspirator, water is used to entrain air to obtain a partial \nvacuum. In the Bunsen-type burner, a jet of gas entrains \nair for combustion. In several instances, entrainment \nmay be detrimental to the operation of steam boilers. \nParticles of ash entrained by the products of combustion, \nwhen deposited on heating surfaces, reduce thermal \nconductance, erode fan blades, and add to emissions \nwhen discharged into the atmosphere. Moisture carrying \nsolids, either in suspension or in solution, are entrained \nin the stream. The solids may be carried through to the \nturbine and deposited on the blades, decreasing turbine \ncapacity and efficiency. In downcomers or supply tubes, \nsteam bubbles are entrained in the water when the drag \non the bubbles is greater than the buoyant force. This \nreduces the density in the pumping column of natural \ncirculation boilers.\nBoiler Circulation\nAn adequate flow of water and steam-water mixture \nis necessary for steam generation and control of tube \nmetal temperatures in all circuits of a steam generating \nunit. At supercritical pressures this flow is produced \nmechanically by pumps. At subcritical pressures, \ncirculation is produced by the force of gravity or pumps, \nor a combination of the two. The elements of single-phase \nflow discussed in this chapter, two-phase flow discussed \nin Chapter 5, heat input rates, and selected limiting \ndesign criteria are combined to evaluate the circulation in \nfossil-fired steam generators. The evaluation procedures \nand key criteria are presented in Chapter 5.\nFig. 15  Friction factor (f) as affected by Reynolds number for various \nin-line tube patterns; crossflow gas or air.\n", "char_count": 4108, "metadata": {"unit_id": "unit_003", "section_id": "chapter_4", "section_type": "chapter", "section_title": "(", "is_complete_section": true}}

{"chunk_id": "unit_001_page_001", "page_number": 1, "text": "3-1\nSteam 42 / Fluid Dynamics\nThe Babcock & Wilcox Company\nIn the production and use of steam there are many \nfluid dynamics considerations. Fluid dynamics addresses \nsteam and water flow through pipes, fittings, valves, tube \nbundles, nozzles, orifices, pumps and turbines, as well as \nentire circulating systems. It also considers air and gas \nflow through ducts, flues, tube banks, fans, compressors \nand turbines plus convection flow of gases due to draft \neffect. The fluid may be a liquid or gas but, regardless \nof its state, the essential property of a fluid is that it \nyields under the slightest shear stress. This chapter is \nlimited to the discussion of Newtonian liquids, gases and \nvapors where any shear stress is directly proportional to \na velocity gradient normal to the shear force. The ratio of \nthe shear stress to the velocity gradient is the property \nviscosity represented by the symbol m.\n Liquids and gases are recognized as states of matter. \nIn the liquid state, a fluid is relatively incompressible, \nhaving a definite volume. It is also capable of forming \na free surface interface between itself and its vapor \nor any other fluid with which it does not mix. On the \nother hand, a gas is highly compressible. It expands or \ndiffuses indefinitely and is subject only to the limitations \nof gravitational forces or an enclosing vessel.\nThe term vapor generally implies a gas near saturation \nconditions where the liquid and the gas phase coexist at \nessentially the same temperature and pressure, during \na process such as vaporization or boiling. In a similar \nsense the term gas denotes a highly superheated steam. \nSometimes steam may be treated as an ideal gas, and \ncareful judgment is needed when doing so.\nFluid dynamics principles normally consider the fluid \nto be a continuous region of matter, a continuum, and a \nmolecular model is not required except for rare instances. \nHowever, one property is noteworthy to consider due \nto the effect on steam generation fluid flow and due \nto intermolecular forces. Surface tension, s, is a liquid \nproperty of the vapor-liquid interface and is the energy per \nunit area required to extend the interface. Surface tension \nis important in two-phase systems, such as a mixture \nflowing in a boiler tube, and relates to the shape and flow \nregime of the bubble interface and also to the heat transfer \narea of droplets. Vapor bubbles increase the resistance \nto fluid flow. The surface tension of water is dependent \non temperature and its value goes to zero at the critical \ntemperature [705.47F (374.15C)]. Supercritical water is \nconsidered single phase in fluid dynamics analysis due \nto zero surface tension.\nChapter 3\nFluid Dynamics\nThe recommended correlation1 for the surface tension \nof water and its vapor, s, is:\n\t\n\t\n(1)\nwhere Tc = 647.15K and T is the fluid temperature in K.\nWater in steam generators operating at supercritical \npressure [above 3200.1 psia (22.1 MPa)] will behave as \na single-phase fluid converting from liquid to steam \nwithout creating bubbles. At the critical pressure and \ncritical temperature, the density of water and steam are \nidentical and there is no distinguishable interface at \nequilibrium conditions. Surface tension is also related \nto the latent heat of vaporization which also decreases to \nzero at the critical temperature.2 This chapter discusses \nsingle-phase fluid flow. Chapter 5 pertains to two-phase \nfluid flow that occurs in boiling tube circuits.\nFundamental Relationships\nThree fundamental laws of conservation apply to fluid \ndynamics systems: conservation of mass, momentum and \nenergy. With the exception of nuclear reactions where \nminute quantities of mass are converted into energy, \nthese laws must be satisfied in all flowing systems. \nFundamental mathematical relationships for these \nprinciples are presented in several different forms that \nmay be applied in particular fluid dynamics situations \nto provide an appropriate solution method. However, full \nanalytical solutions are frequently too complex without \nthe use of a computer. Simplified forms of the full equa­\ntions can be derived by applying engineering judgment \nto drop negligible terms and consider only terms of \nsignificant magnitude for certain classes of problems. \nFluid dynamics problems can be classified as compress­\nible or incompressible, viscous or inviscid. Engineering \npractice is based upon applying various assumptions and \nempirical relationships to obtain a practical method of \nsolution.
