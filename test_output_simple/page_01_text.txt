Steam 42 / Heat Transfer
The Babcock & Wilcox Company
Heat transfer involves the transmission of thermal 
energy and plays a central role in most energy conver­
sion processes. Heat transfer is important in fossil fuel 
combustion, chemical reaction processes, electrical 
systems, nuclear fission and certain fluid systems. It 
also occurs during everyday activities including cooking, 
heating and refrigeration, as well as being an important 
consideration in choosing clothing for different climates.
Although the fundamentals of heat transfer are simple, 
practical applications are complex because real systems 
contain irregular geometries, combined modes of heat 
transfer and time dependent responses.
Fundamentals
Basic modes of heat transfer
There are three modes of heat transfer: conduction, 
convection and radiation. One or more of these modes 
controls the amount of heat transfer in all applications. 
Conduction  Temperature is a property that indicates
the kinetic energy possessed by the molecules of a 
substance; the higher the temperature the greater the 
kinetic energy or molecular activity of the substance. 
Molecular conduction of heat is simply the transfer of 
energy due to a temperature difference between adjacent 
molecules in a solid, liquid or gas.
Conduction heat transfer is evaluated using Fourier’s 
law:

The flow of heat, qc, is positive when the temperature 
gradient, dT/dx, is negative. This result, consistent with 
the second law of thermodynamics, indicates that heat 
flows in the direction of decreasing temperature. The 
heat flow, qc, is in a direction normal (or perpendicular) 
to an area, A, and the gradient, dT/dx, is the rate of 
temperature change in the direction of heat flow. The 
thermal conductivity, k, a property of the material, 
quantifies its ability to conduct heat. A range of thermal 
conductivities is listed in Table 1. The integrated form 
of the conduction law is written:

conductivity on the temperature distribution. The 
grouping kA/L is known as the thermal conductance, Kc; 
the inverse L/kA is known as the thermal resistance, Rc 
and Kc = 1/Rc.
A special case of conduction is the thermal contact 
resistance across a joint between solid materials. At the 
interface of two solid materials the surface-to-surface 
contact is imperfect from the gap that prevails due to 
surface roughness. In nuclear applications with fuel 
pellets and fuel cladding, surface contact resistance can 
have a major impact on heat transfer. If one dimensional 
steady heat flow is assumed, the heat transfer across a 
gap is defined by:
	
	
(3)
where the quantity Rct is called the thermal contact 
resistance, 1/hctA, and hct is called the contact coefficient. 
T1 and T2 are the average surface temperatures on each 
side of the gap. Tabulated values of the contact coefficient 
are presented in References 1 and 2. Examples include 
300 Btu/h ft2 F (1.7 kW/m2 K) between two sections of 
ground 304 stainless steel in air and 25,000 Btu/h ft2 
F (142 kW/m2 K) between two sections of ground copper 
in air. The factors are usually unknown for specific 
applications and estimates need to be made. There are 
two principal contributions across the gap — solid-to-solid 
conduction at the points of contact and thermal conduction 
through the entrapped gases in the void spaces.
